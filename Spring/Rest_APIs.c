To develop RESTful APIs in Java using the Spring Framework, you would typically use the Spring Web module. Spring Web provides tools and features to create web applications and RESTful APIs. One of the key components within Spring Web is the Spring Web MVC framework, which is used for building web applications and exposing APIs.

Here are the key steps you would follow to create RESTful APIs using Spring Web:

1. **Set Up a Spring Boot Project:**
   Spring Boot is a popular choice for building Spring applications, including RESTful APIs. It simplifies the setup and configuration of your project. You can use the Spring Initializr to generate a Spring Boot project with the required dependencies.

2. **Create Controller Classes:**
   In Spring Web, controllers are responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning appropriate responses. Create controller classes with methods annotated with `@RequestMapping` or specific HTTP method annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

3. **Define API Endpoints:**
   Within your controller methods, define the API endpoints by using annotations like `@RequestMapping` or method-specific annotations. These endpoints map to specific URLs and HTTP methods.

4. **Handle Requests and Responses:**
   In your controller methods, you can use method parameters annotated with `@RequestParam`, `@PathVariable`, or `@RequestBody` to handle incoming data from requests. You can also return data as JSON or other formats using appropriate annotations.

5. **Add Business Logic:**
   Implement your business logic inside the controller methods or delegate it to service classes. The service classes can interact with databases, perform calculations, or execute any necessary tasks.

6. **Error Handling:**
   Implement error handling and exception handling within your application. Spring provides mechanisms to handle different types of errors and exceptions gracefully.

7. **Testing:**
   Write unit tests for your controller methods using testing frameworks like JUnit. You can use tools like Mockito to mock dependencies and perform comprehensive testing.

8. **Security and Authorization:**
   If your RESTful APIs require security, you can integrate Spring Security to secure your endpoints and handle user authentication and authorization.

In addition to Spring Web, the Spring Framework offers various other modules and technologies to assist in different areas of development:

- **Spring Data:** For simplifying database access and interaction.
- **Spring Boot:** For quickly setting up and configuring Spring applications.
- **Spring Security:** For handling authentication, authorization, and security concerns.
- **Spring Cloud:** For building and managing microservices and cloud-native applications.
- **Spring Integration:** For building message-driven and integration-centric applications.
- **Spring Batch:** For processing large volumes of data in batch jobs.
- **Spring AOP:** For implementing Aspect-Oriented Programming, enabling cross-cutting concerns.
- **Spring Testing:** For testing Spring applications using various testing frameworks.

These are just a few examples of the many modules and technologies available within the Spring Framework ecosystem. Depending on your project's requirements, you can choose the relevant modules to assist you in various aspects of software development using Java and Spring.

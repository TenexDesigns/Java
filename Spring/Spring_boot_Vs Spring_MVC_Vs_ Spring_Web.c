"Spring Boot," "Spring Web," and "Spring MVC" are related concepts within the Spring Framework ecosystem, but they serve different purposes and are often used in combination to build web applications, including RESTful APIs. Lets break down each concept:

1. **Spring Boot:**
   Spring Boot is a project within the Spring ecosystem that focuses on simplifying the process of building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications. It provides a set of conventions, defaults, and auto-configurations that help developers quickly set up Spring applications without requiring extensive configuration. Spring Boot is particularly useful for creating microservices, web applications, and APIs.

   Key Features:
   - Automatic configuration of Spring components.
   - Embedded web server support.
   - Opinionated defaults that reduce the need for manual configuration.
   - Built-in production-ready features like metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration.

2. **Spring Web:**
   "Spring Web" is a general term that encompasses all of the Spring projects and modules related to web development. This includes Spring Web MVC, Spring Web Reactive (Spring WebFlux), Spring Web Services, and more. In the context of building web applications and APIs, Spring Web MVC and Spring WebFlux are particularly relevant.

3. **Spring MVC:**
   Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework for building web applications based on the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. Its part of the Spring Web project and provides a powerful and flexible way to create web applications. Its been widely used for building traditional, synchronous web applications.

   Key Features:
   - Request mapping and handling for creating web endpoints (controllers).
   - Integration with various view technologies for rendering HTML pages.
   - Form handling, data binding, and validation.
   - Support for internationalization and localization.
   - Interceptors for cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, etc.

In summary:

- **Spring Boot:** Provides opinionated defaults and auto-configurations to simplify the setup of Spring applications, including web applications and RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Web:** Encompasses all Spring projects related to web development, including Spring MVC and Spring WebFlux.
- **Spring MVC:** A framework for building web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern, suitable for traditional web applications.

When building modern web applications, Spring Boot is often used to set up the application quickly, while Spring Web (including Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux) provides the tools to create web endpoints and manage the HTTP layer of your application, including RESTful APIs.

Concurrency in Java refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously, allowing for more efficient use of system resources and better responsiveness. One of the fundamental constructs for achieving concurrency in Java is through threads and synchronization mechanisms. Here's an overview of concurrency in Java and some common ways to implement it:

1. **Threads**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Java provides built-in support for creating and managing threads through the `Thread` class or the `Runnable` interface.

    ```java
    // Extending Thread class
    class MyThread extends Thread {
        public void run() {
            // Code to be executed by the thread
        }
    }
    
    // Implementing Runnable interface
    class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            // Code to be executed by the thread
        }
    }
    
    // Creating and starting threads
    MyThread thread1 = new MyThread();
    thread1.start();
    
    Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
    thread2.start();
    ```

2. **Synchronization**: When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, synchronization is necessary to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency. In Java, synchronization can be achieved using the `synchronized` keyword or by using explicit locks from the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package.

    ```java
    class Counter {
        private int count = 0;
        
        public synchronized void increment() {
            count++;
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Executor Framework**: Java provides the `Executor` framework to manage and execute threads more efficiently. It includes interfaces like `Executor`, `ExecutorService`, and classes like `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`.

    ```java
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
    executor.submit(new MyRunnable());
    executor.shutdown();
    ```

4. **Callable and Future**: The `Callable` interface is similar to `Runnable` but can return a result and throw a checked exception. The `Future` interface represents the result of an asynchronous computation.

    ```java
    Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
        // Compute result
        return result;
    };
    
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(task);
    Integer result = future.get();
    ```

5. **Atomic Variables**: Classes in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package provide atomic operations on variables without needing explicit synchronization. This can be useful for simple operations like incrementing counters in a thread-safe manner.

    ```java
    AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
    counter.incrementAndGet();
    ```

6. **Thread Safety Annotations**: Java provides annotations like `@ThreadSafe`, `@Immutable`, and `@NotThreadSafe` to document the thread safety of classes and methods. These annotations help in understanding the concurrency behavior of the code.

    ```java
    @ThreadSafe
    class MyThreadSafeClass {
        // Thread-safe implementation
    }
    ```

These are some common ways to implement concurrency in Java. Depending on the requirements and complexity of your application, you may need to choose the appropriate concurrency mechanisms.

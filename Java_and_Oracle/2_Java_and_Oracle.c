Oracle offers licensing for their JDK primarily for organizations that require specific commercial features, support, and enterprise-level tools. While OpenJDK is a robust open-source alternative, some enterprises may seek additional services and support directly from Oracle. Here are more details to address your questions:

1. **Oracle JDK vs. OpenJDK:**
   - Oracle JDK typically includes additional features and tools that are not part of the OpenJDK distribution, such as Java Flight Recorder, Java Mission Control, and Oracle's commercial support.
   - OpenJDK is feature-rich and provides the core Java SE platform, but certain enterprise-specific tools might be lacking.

2. **Java Language Freedom:**
   - Yes, the Java programming language itself is free to use. Applications developed using Java do not require an Oracle subscription.

3. **Java Ecosystem (Spring, Java EE, etc.):**
   - Java EE (now Jakarta EE) and frameworks like Spring are open-source technologies built on top of the Java programming language. They are not owned by Oracle and are not subject to Oracle's licensing terms.
   - These technologies operate under their own open-source licenses and community governance.

4. **Oracle's Motivation for Acquiring Sun Microsystems:**
   - Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2010 was motivated by gaining control over a wide array of technologies, including Java, Solaris (an operating system), hardware offerings, and more. Java was a prominent asset in Sun's portfolio due to its widespread adoption and importance in enterprise applications.

5. **Java's Open Source and Licensing Status:**
   - Java is an open-source programming language and platform. However, there have been instances where Oracle's management of Java has caused concerns in the community. Oracle's licensing changes and legal disputes in the past have led to uncertainty and disagreements.

6. **Using Java and Potential Conflicts:**
   - Using Java itself does not inherently lead to conflicts with Oracle. The open-source nature of Java (through OpenJDK) and the open-source projects based on it (like Spring and Jakarta EE) mitigate these concerns.
   - Conflicts could arise if you use Oracle's commercial features without appropriate licensing, or if you rely heavily on Oracle's JDK in a commercial environment without adhering to Oracle's terms.

In summary, while Oracle offers commercial licensing and support for their JDK, there is a vibrant open-source ecosystem around Java, including OpenJDK, Spring, Jakarta EE, and more. Developers and organizations have options to choose what suits their needs best, whether it's leveraging free and open-source solutions or opting for commercial support from Oracle. It's always important to carefully read and understand licensing terms and consider your organization's specific requirements before making decisions.

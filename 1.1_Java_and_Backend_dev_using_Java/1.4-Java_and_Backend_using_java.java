To become a competent Java developer, especially in the backend development field, there are several key areas you should focus on. Here are some important concepts and skills you need to know:

1. Java Programming Language: Gain a strong understanding of the Java programming language, including its syntax, data types, control structures, object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, exception handling, and input/output operations.

2. Java Development Tools: Familiarize yourself with popular Java development tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans. These tools provide features like code editing, debugging, and project management, which are essential for efficient development.

3. Java Standard Library: Learn the Java Standard Library, which provides a wide range of classes and APIs for common tasks such as file handling, networking, database connectivity, and multithreading. Understanding these libraries will help you write efficient and robust backend code.

4. Web Development: Gain knowledge of web development concepts and technologies such as HTTP, RESTful APIs, servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF). These technologies are commonly used in backend development to build web applications.

5. Database Management: Learn how to work with databases using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Hibernate. Understand concepts such as data modeling, SQL queries, and database transactions.

6. Frameworks and Libraries: Explore popular Java frameworks and libraries used in backend development, such as Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and Apache Maven. These tools provide a structured and efficient way to develop scalable and maintainable applications.

7. Testing and Debugging: Acquire skills in writing unit tests using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito. Learn how to debug and troubleshoot Java applications using debugging tools and techniques.

To develop your competence as a backend developer, consider working on the following projects:

1. Build a RESTful API: Create a backend application that exposes RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD operations on a specific domain, such as a user management system or a product catalog.

2. Implement Authentication and Authorization: Develop a secure authentication and authorization system using technologies like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth.

3. Database Integration: Build a backend application that interacts with a database, performs CRUD operations, and handles data validation and persistence.

4. Asynchronous Processing: Explore asynchronous programming in Java using frameworks like Java's CompletableFuture or libraries like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for message queuing and event-driven architectures.

5. Performance Optimization: Optimize the performance of a backend application by implementing caching mechanisms, database indexing, and load balancing techniques.

Remember, practice is key to becoming a competent Java backend developer. Continuously work on projects, contribute to open-source projects, and stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in Java development.

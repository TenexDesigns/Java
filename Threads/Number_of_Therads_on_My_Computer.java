The number of threads available on your CPU is a hardware characteristic and not specific to Java or any other programming language. Modern CPUs are designed with multiple cores, and each core can handle multiple threads simultaneously through a technology called hyper-threading. This allows for improved multitasking and parallel processing.

On Windows, you can find out the number of logical processors (which includes the count of threads) through various methods:

**Method 1: Task Manager**
1. Right-click the taskbar and select "Task Manager."
2. In the Task Manager window, go to the "Performance" tab.
3. Under the "CPU" section, you'll see the number of "Logical processors." This includes both physical cores and hyper-threaded threads.

**Method 2: System Information**
1. Press the Windows key and type "System Information," then select the corresponding result.
2. In the System Information window, navigate to "System Summary" in the left pane.
3. Look for the "Processor" entry on the right side. It will show you the number of "Logical Processors."

**Method 3: Command Prompt**
1. Open the Command Prompt.
2. Run the command `wmic cpu get NumberOfLogicalProcessors`. This will display the number of logical processors.

Keep in mind that the number of logical processors (threads) might differ from the number of physical cores, especially when hyper-threading is enabled. Hyper-threading allows each physical core to simulate two threads, effectively doubling the number of threads available.

The concept of threads and parallelism is not specific to Java. Its a general concept in computer science and applies to most programming languages. In Java, you can use threads directly (using the `Thread` class) or take advantage of higher-level abstractions like the Java Stream API's parallel processing capabilities. The number of threads used by parallel streams in Java is determined by the parallelism configuration and the number of available CPU cores.

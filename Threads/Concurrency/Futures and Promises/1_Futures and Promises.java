Futures and promises are related concurrency constructs that allow you to work with the results of asynchronous computations in a more convenient and efficient manner. They are used to handle tasks that might take some time to complete, such as I/O operations, network requests, or computations that don't block the main thread.

**Futures:**
A `Future` represents a value or an exception that will be available in the future. It acts as a placeholder for the result of an asynchronous computation. You can use a `Future` to start a task and then continue with other work while periodically checking if the result is ready.

**Promises:**
A `Promise` is similar to a `Future`, but it's more like a two-way communication channel between the producer of a result and the consumer of that result. Promises are usually used in scenarios where you're not just interested in consuming the result, but you also have control over producing it.

In Java, `Future` was introduced in the `java.util.concurrent` package to handle asynchronous tasks. However, `Future` had limitations, such as the inability to directly influence or cancel the task, and the lack of composability. To address these limitations, many modern concurrency libraries have introduced the concept of `CompletableFuture`.

**CompletableFuture:**
The `CompletableFuture` class is a more versatile and powerful replacement for `Future` and `Promise` constructs. It's part of Java's standard library starting from Java 8 and provides enhanced capabilities for working with asynchronous tasks.

`CompletableFuture` provides methods to chain multiple asynchronous tasks, combine their results, handle exceptions, and even create complex workflows. It allows you to transform, combine, and manipulate asynchronous results in a functional and composable way.

Here's a brief comparison:

- **Future:**
  - Represents a result of an asynchronous computation.
  - Limited control over the computation.
  - Limited composability.
  - Java 5+.

- **Promise:**
  - Similar to a two-way communication channel.
  - Offers more control over the computation.
  - Not natively part of Java's standard library.
  - Used in some third-party libraries.

- **CompletableFuture:**
  - Extends the concept of `Future`.
  - Enhanced control, composition, and manipulation of asynchronous tasks.
  - Part of Java's standard library (Java 8+).
  - Offers more features and convenience.

In modern concurrency libraries, like Java's `CompletableFuture`, you have powerful tools to handle asynchronous tasks with more control, better composability, and a more expressive programming style. Therefore, for most purposes, you would prefer using `CompletableFuture` or similar constructs over traditional `Future` and `Promise` constructs.

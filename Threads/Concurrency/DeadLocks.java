A deadlock is a situation in which two or more threads are unable to proceed with their execution because each thread is waiting for a resource that is held by another thread in the set. Deadlocks can lead to a complete standstill of the program, where no thread can make progress, resulting in a non-responsive system.

Deadlocks can occur when four conditions are met simultaneously, known as the "four necessary conditions for a deadlock":

1. **Mutual Exclusion:** At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode. This means only one thread can access the resource at a time.

2. **Hold and Wait:** A thread must hold at least one resource and must be waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.

3. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a thread; they can only be released voluntarily by the thread holding them.

4. **Circular Wait:** A circular chain of two or more threads exists, where each thread is waiting for a resource held by another thread in the chain.

To prevent or solve deadlocks, you can apply various strategies:

1. **Avoidance:**
   - Use techniques to ensure that the four necessary conditions for a deadlock do not hold simultaneously.
   - Requires careful resource allocation and scheduling to avoid situations that could lead to deadlocks.
   - Resource allocation graphs and the Banker's algorithm are used to analyze and prevent potential deadlocks.

2. **Prevention:**
   - Eliminate one or more of the four necessary conditions to avoid the possibility of deadlocks.
   - For example, impose a rule that a thread must release all its resources before requesting additional resources, breaking the "Hold and Wait" condition.

3. **Detection and Recovery:**
   - Allow deadlocks to occur but periodically check for their presence and take corrective actions.
   - Resource allocation graphs or other techniques can be used to detect deadlocks.
   - Recovery strategies might involve releasing resources held by some threads or restarting affected threads.

Here's a simple Java code example illustrating a potential deadlock scenario and its resolution using the "prevention" approach:

```java
public class DeadlockExample {
    private static final Object resource1 = new Object();
    private static final Object resource2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (resource1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Holding resource 1...");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Waiting for resource 2...");
                synchronized (resource2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1: Acquired resource 2.");
                }
            }
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (resource2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Holding resource 2...");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Waiting for resource 1...");
                synchronized (resource1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Acquired resource 1.");
                }
            }
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, `thread1` and `thread2` each attempt to acquire two resources in reverse order. This can lead to a deadlock, where each thread holds one resource and waits for the other. To prevent this, you can enforce an ordering on resource acquisition, ensuring both threads acquire resources in the same order.

Remember that deadlocks are complex and can be challenging to detect and resolve, especially in larger systems. It's crucial to carefully design your programs and use proper synchronization techniques to minimize the risk of deadlocks occurring.

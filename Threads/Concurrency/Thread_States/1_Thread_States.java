Thread States:

Threads go through different states during their lifecycle, such as NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, and TERMINATED.


Sure, I'd be happy to explain the different thread states and provide code samples to illustrate each state. Keep in mind that thread states can be transient, and a thread can move between these states as it executes.

Here are the thread states along with explanations and code samples:

1. **NEW:**
   A thread is in the NEW state when it's newly created but not yet started. This state arises when you create a thread object but haven't called its `start()` method.

   ```java
   Thread newThread = new Thread(() -> {
       System.out.println("Thread is in the NEW state.");
   });
   ```

2. **RUNNABLE:**
   A thread is in the RUNNABLE state when it's ready to run, waiting for the CPU to execute it. This state occurs after calling the `start()` method.

   ```java
   Thread runnableThread = new Thread(() -> {
       System.out.println("Thread is in the RUNNABLE state.");
   });
   runnableThread.start();
   ```

3. **BLOCKED:**
   A thread is in the BLOCKED state when it's waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block or method. It occurs when a thread is trying to access a synchronized section already locked by another thread.

   ```java
   Object lock = new Object();

   Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
       synchronized (lock) {
           System.out.println("Thread 1 is in a synchronized block.");
       }
   });

   Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
       synchronized (lock) {
           System.out.println("Thread 2 is in a synchronized block.");
       }
   });

   thread1.start();
   thread2.start();
   ```

4. **WAITING:**
   A thread is in the WAITING state when it's waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action. For example, a thread can enter this state by calling the `Object.wait()` method.

   ```java
   Thread waitingThread = new Thread(() -> {
       synchronized (lock) {
           try {
               lock.wait(); // Thread enters WAITING state
               System.out.println("Thread is awake from waiting.");
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   });
   waitingThread.start();
   ```

5. **TIMED_WAITING:**
   A thread is in the TIMED_WAITING state when it's waiting for a specified period of time. For instance, it can occur when a thread calls methods like `Thread.sleep()` or `Object.wait(timeout)`.

   ```java
   Thread timedWaitingThread = new Thread(() -> {
       try {
           Thread.sleep(1000); // Thread enters TIMED_WAITING state
           System.out.println("Thread has awakened from timed waiting.");
       } catch (InterruptedException e) {
           e.printStackTrace();
       }
   });
   timedWaitingThread.start();
   ```

6. **TERMINATED:**
   A thread is in the TERMINATED state when it has finished its execution or has been explicitly terminated using the `Thread.stop()` method (which is not recommended due to potential issues).

   ```java
   Thread terminatedThread = new Thread(() -> {
       System.out.println("Thread is in the TERMINATED state.");
   });
   terminatedThread.start();
   // After execution, the thread will be in the TERMINATED state.
   ```

These are the various thread states and how they can be used in Java. Keep in mind that the sequence of states and their transitions can vary based on the behavior of the threads, the scheduling by the operating system, and the interactions between threads in a program.

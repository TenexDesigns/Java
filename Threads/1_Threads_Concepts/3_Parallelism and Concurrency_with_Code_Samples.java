Certainly, I can guide you through implementing both parallelism and concurrency using threads or multithreading in Java using the two approaches you mentioned: implementing the `Runnable` interface and using the `ExecutorService` framework.

**1. Implementing Parallelism and Concurrency using Runnable Interface:**

In this approach, you can create multiple threads to achieve parallelism by having each thread perform a separate task simultaneously. You can also achieve concurrency by dividing a single task into smaller subtasks executed by different threads.

Here's an example demonstrating both parallelism and concurrency:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Parallelism: Two threads performing different tasks
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new TaskOne());
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new TaskTwo());

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        // Concurrency: Divide a single task into subtasks
        int totalTasks = 4;
        for (int i = 0; i < totalTasks; i++) {
            Thread subTask = new Thread(new SubTask(i));
            subTask.start();
        }
    }

    static class TaskOne implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Task One executed");
        }
    }

    static class TaskTwo implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Task Two executed");
        }
    }

    static class SubTask implements Runnable {
        private int id;

        SubTask(int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }

        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Subtask " + id + " executed");
        }
    }
}
```

**2. Implementing Parallelism and Concurrency using ExecutorService Framework:**

Using the `ExecutorService` framework allows you to manage threads more efficiently. You can achieve parallelism and concurrency by submitting tasks to the thread pool.

Here's how you can do it:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Parallelism: Using ExecutorService for different tasks
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        executor.submit(new TaskOne());
        executor.submit(new TaskTwo());

        // Concurrency: Using ExecutorService for subtasks
        int totalTasks = 4;
        ExecutorService subTaskExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(totalTasks);
        for (int i = 0; i < totalTasks; i++) {
            subTaskExecutor.submit(new SubTask(i));
        }

        executor.shutdown();
        subTaskExecutor.shutdown();
    }

    static class TaskOne implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Task One executed");
        }
    }

    static class TaskTwo implements Runnable {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Task Two executed");
        }
    }

    static class SubTask implements Runnable {
        private int id;

        SubTask(int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }

        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Subtask " + id + " executed");
        }
    }
}
```

In both approaches, you can observe parallelism when tasks are executed concurrently by different threads, and you can achieve concurrency by dividing a single task into smaller subtasks executed concurrently by multiple threads. The `ExecutorService` framework makes managing these tasks and threads more convenient and efficient.

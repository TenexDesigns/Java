The visibility problem in Java threads occurs when changes made to a shared variable by one thread are not immediately visible to other threads. This can lead to unpredictable and incorrect behavior in a multithreaded application. The Java Memory Model (JMM) allows for optimizations that may cause updates to variables to be visible to some threads but not others, unless proper synchronization mechanisms are used.

Here's an example of the visibility problem:

```java
class SharedResource {
    private boolean flag = false;

    public void toggleFlag() {
        flag = !flag;  // Change made by one thread
    }

    public boolean isFlag() {
        return flag;   // Read by another thread
    }
}

public class VisibilityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            resource.toggleFlag();
            System.out.println("Flag set to true by Thread 1");
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            while (!resource.isFlag()) {
                // Busy-wait until flag becomes true
            }
            System.out.println("Flag is true in Thread 2");
        });

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `flag` variable is accessed and modified by two different threads. The `toggleFlag()` method is called in `Thread 1`, and the `isFlag()` method is called in `Thread 2`. Without proper synchronization, `Thread 2` may not immediately see the change made by `Thread 1`.

To solve the visibility problem and ensure that changes to shared variables are properly visible across threads, you need to use synchronization mechanisms:

1. **Synchronization with `synchronized`:**
   You can use the `synchronized` keyword to create a synchronized block or method that ensures a memory barrier, forcing changes to be flushed from a thread's local cache to main memory, and ensuring that changes made by one thread are visible to others.

2. **Volatile Keyword:**
   Marking a variable as `volatile` ensures that reads and writes to that variable have a memory barrier effect, preventing certain optimizations that can lead to visibility issues.

3. **Using Locks (`Lock` or `ReentrantLock`):**
   Explicit locks can also be used to synchronize access to shared variables. Locking provides more control and flexibility over synchronization than `synchronized` methods or blocks.

4. **Atomic Classes:**
   The classes in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package, such as `AtomicInteger` and `AtomicBoolean`, provide atomic operations that can be used to update shared variables safely without the need for explicit synchronization.

Applying one of these mechanisms ensures that changes made to shared variables in one thread are visible to other threads, thus solving the visibility problem. However, it's important to choose the appropriate synchronization mechanism based on the complexity of your application and the level of synchronization required.

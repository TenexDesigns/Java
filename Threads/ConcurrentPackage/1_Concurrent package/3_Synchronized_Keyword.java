The `synchronized` keyword in Java is used to provide mutual exclusion or synchronization between threads accessing a shared resource or a critical section of code. It ensures that only one thread can execute the synchronized block or method at a time, preventing race conditions and maintaining thread safety.

Here's how the `synchronized` keyword is used:

1. **Synchronized Block:**
   You can enclose a block of code within a `synchronized` block to ensure that only one thread can execute that block at a time.

   ```java
   synchronized (object) {
       // Code that needs to be synchronized
   }
   ```

   In this case, `object` is used as a monitor or lock that controls access to the synchronized block. Multiple threads attempting to enter synchronized blocks using the same monitor will be serialized, ensuring that only one thread executes the synchronized code at any given time.

2. **Synchronized Method:**
   You can also declare an entire method as synchronized by using the `synchronized` keyword in the method signature.

   ```java
   public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
       // Code that needs to be synchronized
   }
   ```

   When a synchronized method is called on an object, the lock associated with that object is acquired, preventing other threads from executing synchronized methods on the same object concurrently.

3. **Static Synchronized Method:**
   You can use the `synchronized` keyword with static methods to synchronize access to the method at the class level.

   ```java
   public static synchronized void staticSynchronizedMethod() {
       // Code that needs to be synchronized
   }
   ```

   When a static synchronized method is called, the lock is acquired at the class level, preventing other threads from executing any static synchronized methods of the same class concurrently.

It's important to note the following about the `synchronized` keyword:

- Using `synchronized` blocks or methods ensures thread safety by preventing multiple threads from accessing shared resources concurrently.

- While `synchronized` provides synchronization, it can also introduce performance overhead due to the contention for locks, especially in scenarios with high concurrency.

- Use `synchronized` judiciously. Applying synchronization too broadly can lead to reduced parallelism and performance bottlenecks. Instead, focus on synchronizing only critical sections of code that access shared resources.

- Consider other synchronization mechanisms such as `Lock` interfaces, `ReentrantLock`, and atomic classes in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package. These provide more control over synchronization and can offer better performance in some scenarios.

In modern Java programming, the use of higher-level abstractions, such as the `ExecutorService` framework and the `java.util.concurrent` package, can often help manage concurrency without needing to explicitly use `synchronized` blocks or methods.








MEANING OF OBJECT OR lOCK
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the context of the `synchronized` keyword and its usage, the term "object" refers to a Java object that is used as a monitor or lock to control access to a synchronized block of code or method. This object serves as a synchronization point that ensures mutual exclusion, meaning that only one thread can execute the synchronized code section at a time.

Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1. **Synchronized Block:**
   In a synchronized block, the `object` acts as a lock. When a thread enters the synchronized block, it acquires the lock associated with the `object`. If another thread attempts to enter the same synchronized block while the lock is held, it will be blocked and wait until the lock is released.

   ```java
   synchronized (object) {
       // Code that needs to be synchronized
   }
   ```

   The `object` can be any Java object, and it's used to establish a common synchronization point for threads accessing the same critical section.

2. **Synchronized Method:**
   In a synchronized method, the lock is automatically associated with the object on which the method is being called. For instance, in the following synchronized method, the lock is associated with the instance of the class:

   ```java
   public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
       // Code that needs to be synchronized
   }
   ```

   When a thread calls the `synchronizedMethod()` on an object, it acquires the lock associated with that object. Other threads attempting to call the same method on the same object will be blocked until the lock is released.

3. **Static Synchronized Method:**
   Similarly, in a static synchronized method, the lock is associated with the class itself:

   ```java
   public static synchronized void staticSynchronizedMethod() {
       // Code that needs to be synchronized
   }
   ```

   Here, the lock is at the class level, meaning that multiple threads calling the `staticSynchronizedMethod()` on the same class will contend for the lock.

In summary, the "object" or "lock" is the synchronization mechanism used to coordinate access to a critical section of code or a synchronized method. The choice of the object depends on what you want to synchronize. You can use any object, but often, it's best to use an object that is relevant to the shared resource or section of code you're synchronizing. It's important to choose the right synchronization strategy to avoid deadlocks and contention while ensuring thread safety.



  Certainly! Let's take a closer look at using the `synchronized` keyword with code samples to illustrate the concepts of the synchronization object (lock) and monitor.

1. **Synchronized Block with an Object (Lock):**
   
   ```java
   class SharedResource {
       private int counter = 0;
       private Object lock = new Object(); // Synchronization object (lock)

       public void increment() {
           synchronized (lock) { // Acquire the lock
               counter++;
           } // Release the lock
       }
   }

   public class SynchronizedBlockExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

           Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
               for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                   resource.increment();
               }
           });

           Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
               for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                   resource.increment();
               }
           });

           thread1.start();
           thread2.start();

           try {
               thread1.join();
               thread2.join();
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }

           System.out.println("Counter: " + resource.counter);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Synchronized Method:**

   ```java
   class SharedResource {
       private int counter = 0;

       public synchronized void increment() {
           counter++;
       }
   }

   public class SynchronizedMethodExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

           Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
               for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                   resource.increment();
               }
           });

           Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
               for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
                   resource.increment();
               }
           });

           thread1.start();
           thread2.start();

           try {
               thread1.join();
               thread2.join();
           } catch (InterruptedException e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
           }

           System.out.println("Counter: " + resource.counter);
       }
   }
   ```

In both examples, we have a shared resource (an integer counter) that multiple threads are trying to increment. The `synchronized` keyword is used to synchronize the access to the `increment` method, ensuring that only one thread can modify the counter at a time. The object on which the `synchronized` block or method is applied acts as the synchronization object (lock) or monitor.

In the first example, we explicitly create an object `lock` to act as the synchronization object. In the second example, the lock is associated with the instance of the `SharedResource` object itself.

These examples demonstrate how the `synchronized` keyword uses a lock to ensure that only one thread can execute synchronized code at any given time, preventing race conditions and maintaining thread safety.

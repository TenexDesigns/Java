The Scatter-Gather pattern is a concurrency pattern used to parallelize and aggregate the results of multiple tasks. It involves breaking down a task into smaller subtasks (scattering), executing them concurrently, and then combining their results (gathering). This pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple independent tasks that can be executed concurrently to improve performance.

Here's how you can implement the Scatter-Gather pattern in Java using threads:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class ScatterGatherExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);

        List<Callable<Integer>> tasks = new ArrayList<>();
        tasks.add(() -> performSubtask(1));
        tasks.add(() -> performSubtask(2));
        tasks.add(() -> performSubtask(3));
        tasks.add(() -> performSubtask(4));

        try {
            List<Future<Integer>> results = executorService.invokeAll(tasks);

            int totalResult = 0;
            for (Future<Integer> result : results) {
                totalResult += result.get();
            }

            System.out.println("Total result: " + totalResult);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            executorService.shutdown();
        }
    }

    private static int performSubtask(int subtaskId) {
        // Simulate some processing
        return subtaskId * 10;
    }
}
```

In this example:
- We create an `ExecutorService` with a fixed thread pool size of 4.
- We define a list of `Callable` tasks, each representing a subtask to be executed concurrently.
- The `invokeAll()` method submits all tasks to the executor and returns a list of `Future` objects representing the results of the tasks.
- We iterate over the `Future` results and gather the individual results.
- Finally, we shut down the executor service.

This example demonstrates the basic implementation of the Scatter-Gather pattern using threads and the Executor framework. However, keep in mind that modern Java offers more advanced concurrency mechanisms, such as the `CompletableFuture` class and reactive programming libraries like RxJava or Project Reactor, which provide more elegant ways to implement such patterns with additional features and better control over concurrency.

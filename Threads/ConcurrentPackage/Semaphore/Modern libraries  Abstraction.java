Modern libraries and frameworks often provide higher-level abstractions that build upon the `Semaphore` concept, making it easier to manage concurrency and resource access. These abstractions can help streamline code and simplify synchronization in more complex scenarios. While not always directly named "semaphore," these abstractions share the core idea of controlling access to shared resources.

Here are a few examples:

1. **java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService:**
   The `ExecutorService` interface in the `java.util.concurrent` package provides an abstraction for managing thread pools and executing tasks concurrently. It can be used to limit the number of concurrent tasks being executed, acting as a higher-level abstraction over semaphores.

2. **Connection Pools:**
   Many modern libraries that deal with database connections or other resources provide built-in connection pooling mechanisms. These connection pools internally manage the number of available connections using techniques similar to semaphores.

3. **Fork/Join Framework:**
   The Fork/Join framework, available in the `java.util.concurrent` package, allows you to parallelize tasks that can be split into smaller subtasks. While not exactly a semaphore abstraction, it provides a way to manage parallelism and concurrency more efficiently.

4. **Project Reactor and RxJava:**
   Reactive programming libraries like Project Reactor and RxJava provide constructs like `Flux` and `Observable` that can be used to control and limit the number of concurrent operations.

5. **Akka (Actor Model):**
   Akka's actor model provides a way to manage concurrency and resource access by encapsulating state within actors. While not directly implementing semaphores, it abstracts away many complexities of concurrent programming.

6. **Rate Limiting Libraries:**
   Some libraries specialize in rate limiting, which controls access to a resource based on a certain rate or number of permits. While not exactly semaphores, they achieve a similar goal of controlled access.

While these abstractions might not use the term "semaphore," they offer higher-level tools to control concurrency, access to resources, and parallel execution in a more intuitive way. Depending on your specific use case, you might find that these higher-level abstractions provide a better fit for your application's needs.

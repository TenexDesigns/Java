Modern libraries often provide higher-level abstractions and utilities that build upon the capabilities of `CompletableFuture` to further simplify asynchronous programming. These abstractions aim to make working with asynchronous tasks even more intuitive and expressive. Here are a few examples:

1. **Project Reactor (Mono and Flux):**
   Project Reactor is a reactive programming library that provides abstractions called `Mono` and `Flux` for working with asynchronous and event-driven programming. These abstractions go beyond the basic features of `CompletableFuture` by offering more powerful composition and transformation operations, and they are particularly well-suited for handling streams of data.

   ```java
   Mono<Integer> future = Mono.fromFuture(() -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42))
       .map(result -> result * 2)
       .map(result -> "Result: " + result);

   future.subscribe(result -> System.out.println(result));
   ```

2. **RxJava (Observables):**
   RxJava is another reactive programming library that provides the concept of observables and operators for asynchronous and event-driven programming. Observables allow you to work with sequences of events or asynchronous tasks, and the library provides a rich set of operators for transforming and combining them.

   ```java
   Observable<Integer> observable = Observable.fromFuture(() -> CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42))
       .map(result -> result * 2)
       .map(result -> "Result: " + result);

   observable.subscribe(result -> System.out.println(result));
   ```

3. **Vert.x (Vertx and Future):**
   Vert.x is a reactive toolkit for building event-driven applications. It provides abstractions like `Vertx` and `Future` for handling asynchronous operations. While `Future` in Vert.x is similar to `CompletableFuture`, Vert.x offers a range of features for building reactive and non-blocking applications.

   ```java
   Future<Integer> future = Future.future();
   CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> 42)
       .thenApply(result -> result * 2)
       .thenApply(result -> "Result: " + result)
       .thenAccept(result -> future.complete(result));

   future.setHandler(result -> System.out.println(result.result()));
   ```

These libraries offer higher-level abstractions that build on top of `CompletableFuture` and provide a more reactive and declarative approach to handling asynchronous tasks. They are particularly useful when dealing with complex asynchronous scenarios that involve sequences of events, data streams, and complex transformations.

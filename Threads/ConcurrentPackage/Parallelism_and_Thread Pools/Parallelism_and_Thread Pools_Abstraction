Yes, many modern libraries and frameworks provide abstractions that abstract away the complexity of parallelism and thread pool creation. These abstractions are designed to make it easier for developers to leverage parallelism without having to deal with the low-level details of managing threads and thread pools. Some of these abstractions include:

1. **Java's `java.util.concurrent` Package:**
   While not a library or framework on its own, Java's `java.util.concurrent` package provides a set of abstractions and classes that simplify thread and concurrency management. This package includes thread pools, concurrent collections, and synchronization constructs that abstract away much of the complexity.

2. **ExecutorService Framework:**
   Java's `ExecutorService` framework is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and provides a higher-level way to manage threads and parallelism. It abstracts away the creation and management of thread pools, allowing you to focus on submitting tasks for execution.

3. **Fork/Join Framework:**
   Also part of `java.util.concurrent`, the Fork/Join framework abstracts away the complexities of recursive task decomposition for parallel processing.

4. **Akka:**
   Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. It provides abstractions for actor-based programming, which abstract away the details of thread management and synchronization. Akka allows you to create lightweight, isolated actors that communicate and perform work concurrently.

5. **Project Loom (Experimental):**
   Project Loom, an experimental project within OpenJDK, aims to provide lightweight concurrency abstractions, including virtual threads (fibers). These virtual threads are designed to abstract away the complexities of thread management while providing concurrency benefits.

6. **Reactive Streams and Libraries (e.g., RxJava, Reactor):**
   Reactive programming libraries like RxJava and Reactor provide abstractions for asynchronous and event-driven programming. They allow you to express complex asynchronous workflows and handle concurrency challenges without managing low-level threads and synchronization.

7. **Spring Framework and Spring Boot:**
   Spring offers abstractions like the `@Async` annotation, which allows you to easily enable asynchronous methods in your Spring components. Spring Boot provides simplified configuration for common concurrency scenarios.

These abstractions make it easier to leverage parallelism and manage thread pools without needing to dive into the intricacies of thread management. However, understanding the underlying concepts of concurrency and parallelism is still valuable, as it helps you make informed decisions and troubleshoot issues when using these abstractions.

**Parallelism** refers to the execution of multiple tasks or processes at the same time, where each task is divided into smaller subtasks that can be performed simultaneously. In the context of programming, parallelism typically involves utilizing multiple threads or processes to work on different parts of a task concurrently, with the goal of improving overall throughput and performance.

**Thread Pools** are a mechanism to manage and reuse a pool of worker threads, which are pre-created threads that are ready to execute tasks. Thread pools help avoid the overhead of creating and destroying threads for every task, which can be resource-intensive. Thread pools provide a way to efficiently manage concurrency by allowing tasks to be executed in parallel by available worker threads.

**Enabling Parallelism in Java:**

1. **Threads:** The basic unit of parallelism is a thread. You can create and manage threads using the `Thread` class or by implementing the `Runnable` or `Callable` interfaces.

2. **ThreadPool - ExecutorService:** The `ExecutorService` framework in Java's `java.util.concurrent` package provides a higher-level way to enable parallelism. It manages a pool of worker threads and handles task submission, thread allocation, and execution. Various types of thread pools are available, such as fixed-size, cached, and scheduled.

             - forkJoinpool,
             - CustomThreadpools(eg web servers),
3. **Fork/Join Framework:** This framework is designed for recursive decomposition of tasks. The `ForkJoinPool` supports parallel processing by dividing tasks into smaller subtasks that are executed by multiple threads. It's particularly useful for problems that can be divided into subproblems.

4. **Custom Thread Pools:** In some scenarios, such as web servers, custom thread pools can be created to suit specific application requirements. This allows you to fine-tune thread management based on the nature of the tasks and the hardware environment.

**Parallelism and Number of CPU Cores:**

Parallelism is most effective when you have multiple CPU cores available. Each CPU core can execute a thread concurrently. If you have a single-core CPU, parallelism might not provide significant benefits since only one thread can execute at a time. However, on a multi-core CPU, parallelism allows multiple threads to execute simultaneously on different cores, resulting in better utilization of the available resources and improved performance.

**Limitation of Thread Pools:**

While thread pools allow you to manage concurrency efficiently, they are not limited to the number of CPU cores. You can create thread pools with a certain number of threads regardless of the number of cores. The key is to strike a balance between the number of threads in the pool and the available cores. Having too many threads in the pool may lead to overhead due to context switching, while having too few threads may not fully utilize available cores.

In summary, parallelism is the concept of performing tasks concurrently to improve performance. Thread pools, along with other concurrency frameworks, provide mechanisms to enable parallelism in Java applications. The effectiveness of parallelism depends on the availability of multiple CPU cores. Thread pools can be customized based on application requirements, but the number of threads in a thread pool does not necessarily have to match the number of CPU cores.

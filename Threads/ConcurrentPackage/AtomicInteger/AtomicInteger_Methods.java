The `AtomicInteger` class in Java's `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package provides several atomic operations that you can use to work with integers in a thread-safe manner. These methods ensure that the operations are performed atomically without the need for explicit synchronization. Here's an overview of the methods you mentioned and a few more:

1. **`incrementAndGet()`:**
   - Increments the current value by 1 and returns the updated value.

2. **`decrementAndGet()`:**
   - Decrements the current value by 1 and returns the updated value.

3. **`getAndIncrement()`:**
   - Returns the current value and then increments it by 1.

4. **`getAndDecrement()`:**
   - Returns the current value and then decrements it by 1.

5. **`getAndAdd(int delta)`:**
   - Returns the current value and then adds the specified `delta` to it.

6. **`addAndGet(int delta)`:**
   - Adds the specified `delta` to the current value and returns the updated value.

7. **`getAndSet(int newValue)`:**
   - Returns the current value and then sets it to the specified `newValue`.

8. **`compareAndSet(int expect, int update)`:**
   - Atomically compares the current value with `expect`. If they are equal, the value is updated to `update`, and `true` is returned. If they are not equal, no update occurs, and `false` is returned.

9. **`getAndUpdate(IntUnaryOperator updateFunction)`:**
   - Atomically updates the current value using the provided `updateFunction` and returns the old value.

10. **`updateAndGet(IntUnaryOperator updateFunction)`:**
    - Atomically updates the current value using the provided `updateFunction` and returns the new value.

11. **`accumulateAndGet(int x, IntBinaryOperator accumulatorFunction)`:**
    - Atomically updates the current value by applying the provided `accumulatorFunction` to the current value and `x`, and returns the new value.

12. **`getAndAccumulate(int x, IntBinaryOperator accumulatorFunction)`:**
    - Atomically updates the current value by applying the provided `accumulatorFunction` to the current value and `x`, and returns the old value.

These methods provide a way to perform simple arithmetic and modification operations on `AtomicInteger` instances without the need for explicit synchronization. They help you avoid race conditions and ensure that the operations are performed atomically, making them useful in concurrent programming scenarios.

It's important to note that while these atomic operations are powerful for simple use cases, more complex scenarios may require a combination of these operations or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety and correctness.

The ideal pool size for a thread pool depends on various factors, including the nature of the tasks being performed, the available hardware resources, and the specific requirements of your application. Let's address the questions you've raised:

1. **Number of Threads in a Pool:**
   - There's no one-size-fits-all answer to the ideal pool size. Having too few threads may lead to underutilization of resources, while having too many threads can lead to contention for resources and overhead.
   - The maximum number of threads you can create in a pool depends on the available system resources, particularly memory.
   - It's generally not recommended to create a huge number of threads since it can lead to excessive context switching and memory consumption.

2. **Task Scheduling and Excessive Threads:**
   - If you have more threads than available CPU cores, task scheduling and context switching overhead can reduce performance.
   - In cases where you have many threads competing for CPU time, the system might spend more time switching between threads than actually performing useful work.

3. **Getting Number of CPU Cores:**
   - You can use `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()` to get the number of available CPU cores.
   - This number can serve as a rough guideline for setting the thread pool size, especially when dealing with CPU-intensive tasks.

4. **CPU-Intensive and I/O-Intensive Tasks:**
   - **CPU-Intensive Tasks:** These tasks primarily involve computations and processing that heavily use the CPU. For such tasks, it's recommended to set the thread pool size closer to the number of available CPU cores to maximize CPU utilization.
   - **I/O-Intensive Tasks:** These tasks involve waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading/writing files, network requests). Since threads can wait during I/O, you can have a higher thread pool size than the number of cores. This helps keep the CPU busy while some threads wait for I/O.

5. **Determining Thread Pool Size:**
   - For CPU-intensive tasks, a good rule of thumb is to have a thread pool size equal to the number of CPU cores.
   - For I/O-intensive tasks, you can have a higher thread pool size to account for waiting threads. However, be cautious not to have an excessively large thread pool.

6. **Monitoring and Tuning:**
   - Monitor the thread pool's performance and adjust the size based on observed behavior. Too many or too few threads can negatively impact performance.
   - You might experiment with different pool sizes and measure their impact on throughput and resource utilization.

Remember that the effectiveness of the thread pool size depends on the specific workload and the resources available on your system. It's important to strike a balance between resource utilization and overhead to achieve optimal performance. Regular monitoring, testing, and tuning are crucial to ensuring your application's concurrency is well-optimized for its tasks.

Yes, your understanding is correct. Creating individual threads for every task can be resource-intensive and may not scale well. Using an ExecutorService thread pool is a recommended approach in Java when dealing with threads, as it provides a more efficient way to manage and reuse threads for executing tasks.

Here's a bit more detail:

1. **Using a Thread Pool:**
   Instead of creating a new thread for each individual task, using a thread pool allows you to manage a fixed or dynamic number of threads that can be reused to execute multiple tasks. This approach is more memory-efficient and avoids the overhead of creating and destroying threads frequently.

2. **ExecutorService:**
   An ExecutorService is a higher-level concurrency framework that manages the lifecycle of threads and provides a clean API for submitting tasks for execution. It abstracts away the complexities of thread creation and management.

3. **ThreadPoolExecutor:**
   ThreadPoolExecutor is the implementation of ExecutorService in Java that provides configurable thread pooling. You can specify the core pool size, maximum pool size, keep-alive time, and more. Tasks are submitted to the thread pool, and the executor takes care of managing and reusing threads.

4. **Blocking Queue:**
   In the context of thread pools, a blocking queue is a queue that blocks when attempting to dequeue an element if the queue is empty, or blocks when attempting to enqueue an element if the queue is full. Blocking queues are commonly used to hold tasks submitted to a thread pool that can't be immediately executed due to the unavailability of threads. This allows tasks to wait until there's an available thread.

Using a thread pool with a blocking queue is a recommended approach because it provides several benefits:
- Efficiently manages thread creation and reuse.
- Avoids thread creation overhead.
- Prevents overwhelming the system with too many threads.
- Provides a way to handle tasks even when the pool's maximum thread count is reached.

Here's a simple example of using an ExecutorService with a thread pool and a blocking queue:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numThreads = 10;
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);

        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            Runnable task = () -> {
                // Code to be executed by the thread
                System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            };
            executor.submit(task); // Submit task to the thread pool
        }

        executor.shutdown(); // Shutdown the thread pool when done
    }
}
```

In this example, a fixed-size thread pool is created with 10 threads. The loop submits 1000 tasks to the thread pool, and the tasks are executed by the available threads.

In summary, using a thread pool with an ExecutorService is the recommended approach for managing threads in Java due to its efficiency and resource management benefits.

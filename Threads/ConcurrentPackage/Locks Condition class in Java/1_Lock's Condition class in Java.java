In Java, the `Condition` interface is part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package and is used in conjunction with locks to provide more advanced synchronization capabilities than what's available with basic `ReentrantLock` or synchronized blocks. Conditions allow threads to wait for specific conditions to be met before proceeding, providing more fine-grained control over thread synchronization.

Here's an overview of how the `Condition` class works and how you can use it:

1. **Creating a Condition:**
   You can create a `Condition` instance associated with a `ReentrantLock` using the `newCondition()` method of the lock.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class ConditionExample {
    private static ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private static Condition condition = lock.newCondition();
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

2. **Waiting with Condition:**
   Threads can wait using the `await()` method of the `Condition` interface. This temporarily releases the lock and waits for a signal to continue.

```java
lock.lock();
try {
    while (!conditionIsMet()) {
        condition.await();
    }
    // Proceed with the critical section
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

3. **Signaling with Condition:**
   Threads can signal other waiting threads using the `signal()` or `signalAll()` methods of the `Condition` interface. These methods must be called while holding the associated lock.

```java
lock.lock();
try {
    // Perform some actions that fulfill the condition
    condition.signal(); // Signal a single waiting thread
    // or
    condition.signalAll(); // Signal all waiting threads
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

Using `Condition`, you can implement more complex synchronization patterns than just acquiring and releasing locks. It's particularly useful in scenarios where you want threads to wait for specific conditions to be met before they proceed, allowing for better resource utilization and coordination between threads.

Here's an example illustrating the use of `Condition` to implement a simple producer-consumer scenario:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class ProducerConsumerWithCondition {
    private static Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    private static Condition notFull = lock.newCondition();
    private static Condition notEmpty = lock.newCondition();
    private static int[] buffer = new int[10];
    private static int count = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread producer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
                produce(i);
            }
        });

        Thread consumer = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
                consume();
            }
        });

        producer.start();
        consumer.start();

        try {
            producer.join();
            consumer.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }

    private static void produce(int value) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (count == buffer.length) {
                notFull.await();
            }
            buffer[count++] = value;
            notEmpty.signal();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    private static void consume() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            while (count == 0) {
                notEmpty.await();
            }
            int value = buffer[--count];
            notFull.signal();
            System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `notFull` and `notEmpty` conditions are used to signal and wait for specific conditions to be met in the producer-consumer interaction. This allows the producer to wait when the buffer is full and the consumer to wait when the buffer is empty, efficiently coordinating their actions.

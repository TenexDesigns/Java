Yes, modern libraries often provide higher-level abstractions that encapsulate the complexities of managing locks, conditions, and synchronization patterns. These abstractions aim to simplify concurrent programming and provide more intuitive ways to handle thread synchronization. Some of these libraries include:

1. **Akka (Actor Model):**
   Akka is a toolkit for building concurrent and distributed applications using the Actor model. It abstracts away the need for explicit locks and conditions by providing actors that encapsulate state and behavior. Actors communicate through messages, and Akka manages their concurrency and synchronization.

2. **Project Reactor (Reactive Streams):**
   Project Reactor is a reactive programming library that abstracts away much of the low-level synchronization details. It allows you to compose asynchronous and concurrent operations using higher-level abstractions like `Mono` and `Flux`, which handle the complexity of managing concurrency.

3. **RxJava:**
   RxJava is another reactive programming library that offers abstractions for managing asynchronous and concurrent operations. While it may not directly abstract locks and conditions, it provides higher-level constructs for handling complex asynchronous scenarios in a more declarative way.

4. **Vert.x:**
   Vert.x is a reactive toolkit that allows you to build event-driven and non-blocking applications. It provides abstractions for managing concurrency and asynchronous operations using concepts like event loops, asynchronous programming, and reactive streams.

5. **Quasar and Kilim:**
   These libraries provide lightweight threads (also known as fibers or green threads) that can be used in a cooperative multitasking manner. They abstract away the need for explicit locks and conditions by allowing developers to write blocking code without blocking actual OS threads.

While these libraries might not always directly abstract locks and conditions in the same way that `ReentrantLock` and related classes do, they offer higher-level constructs and patterns that make it easier to work with concurrency without having to deal with low-level synchronization details. They aim to provide more readable, maintainable, and scalable concurrent programming solutions.

`ExecutorService` provides several types of thread pools, each suited for different scenarios. These thread pools are created using factory methods in the `Executors` class. Each type of thread pool has a different type of queue for holding tasks. Let's explore the four main types of thread pools and their associated queues, along with code samples for each:

1. **FixedThreadPool:**
   - Creates a fixed-size thread pool with a specified number of threads.
   - Suitable for situations where you want to limit the number of concurrent threads to a specific value.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class FixedThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int numThreads = 3;
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numThreads);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable task = () -> {
                System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            };
            executor.submit(task);
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

2. **CachedThreadPool:**
   - Creates an expandable thread pool that reuses idle threads or creates new ones as needed.
   - Suitable for tasks with varying workloads and when you need to process a large number of short-lived tasks.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class CachedThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable task = () -> {
                System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            };
            executor.submit(task);
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

3. **SingleThreadExecutor:**
   - Creates a single-threaded pool that executes tasks sequentially.
   - Useful when tasks need to be executed in a specific order or when you want to ensure that only one task is active at a time.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class SingleThreadExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable task = () -> {
                System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            };
            executor.submit(task);
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

4. **ScheduledThreadPool:**
   - Creates a thread pool for scheduling tasks to be executed at a specific time or with a fixed delay.
   - Suitable for scenarios where you need to schedule tasks to run periodically.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ScheduledThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);

        Runnable task = () -> {
            System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        };

        // Schedule the task to run after an initial delay of 1 second
        executor.schedule(task, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Schedule the task to run every 2 seconds, starting after an initial delay of 3 seconds
        executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(task, 3, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

Remember to call the `shutdown()` method on the executor when youre done with it to release resources. Choose the appropriate type of thread pool based on your application's requirements and characteristics of the tasks you need to execute.

Certainly! Let's break down each of the methods related to pool size changes and see where they can be used using a `ThreadPoolExecutor` as an example.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.*;

public class ThreadPoolSizeChangesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int corePoolSize = 2; // Initial core pool size
        int maxPoolSize = 5;  // Initial maximum pool size
        long keepAliveTime = 30;
        TimeUnit unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS;
        BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(10);
        ThreadFactory threadFactory = Executors.defaultThreadFactory();
        RejectedExecutionHandler handler = new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy();

        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
                corePoolSize, maxPoolSize, keepAliveTime, unit,
                workQueue, threadFactory, handler);

        // Execute tasks
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable task = () -> {
                System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            };
            executor.submit(task);
        }

        // Adjust core pool size dynamically
        executor.setCorePoolSize(4);

        // Adjust maximum pool size dynamically
        executor.setMaximumPoolSize(7);

        // Adjust keep-alive time for excess idle threads
        executor.setKeepAliveTime(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this example, we're using the `ThreadPoolExecutor` to create a thread pool with initial core and maximum pool sizes, a keep-alive time, and other configurations.

1. **Adjust Core Pool Size:**
   The `setCorePoolSize(int corePoolSize)` method allows you to change the core number of threads after the pool has been created. It's useful for dynamically adjusting the number of threads to match the workload. In the example, after submitting tasks, we increase the core pool size from 2 to 4 using `executor.setCorePoolSize(4)`.

2. **Adjust Maximum Pool Size:**
   Similarly, the `setMaximumPoolSize(int maximumPoolSize)` method lets you change the maximum allowed number of threads after the pool has been created. This is useful when you need to accommodate higher workloads temporarily. In the example, we increase the maximum pool size from 5 to 7 using `executor.setMaximumPoolSize(7)`.

3. **Adjust Keep-Alive Time:**
   The `setKeepAliveTime(long time, TimeUnit unit)` method changes the time that excess idle threads (beyond the core pool size) will wait before being terminated. It's helpful for controlling resource usage. In the example, we increase the keep-alive time to 60 seconds using `executor.setKeepAliveTime(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)`.

These methods allow you to fine-tune the thread pool's behavior based on workload changes and resource availability. Remember that adjusting these values too frequently might introduce additional overhead due to thread creation and termination, so use them judiciously based on your application's needs.

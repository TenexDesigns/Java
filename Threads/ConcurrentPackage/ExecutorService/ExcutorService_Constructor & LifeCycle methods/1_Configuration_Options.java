The configuration options you mentioned, such as pool size changes, queue types, task rejections, lifecycle methods, and constructor parameters, are applicable to different types of thread pools provided by `ExecutorService`. Let's explore how these options apply to various thread pool types along with some common values:

1. **Pool Size Changes:**
   You can adjust the pool size (number of threads) dynamically using the following methods:
   - `setCorePoolSize(int corePoolSize)`: Set the core number of threads.
   - `setMaximumPoolSize(int maximumPoolSize)`: Set the maximum allowed number of threads.
   - `setKeepAliveTime(long time, TimeUnit unit)`: Set the time that excess idle threads will wait before being terminated.

2. **Queue Types:**
   Different thread pool implementations have different types of queues to hold tasks that cannot be immediately executed:
   - `ThreadPoolExecutor`: Offers several queue implementations such as `LinkedBlockingQueue` (unbounded) and `ArrayBlockingQueue` (bounded).
   - `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor`: Typically uses a delay queue.

3. **Task Rejections:**
   If a thread pool's queue and maximum pool size are both full, the pool can reject tasks. You can set a `RejectedExecutionHandler` to handle rejected tasks. Common policies include `AbortPolicy`, `CallerRunsPolicy`, and `DiscardPolicy`.

4. **Lifecycle Methods:**
   Thread pools have lifecycle methods like `shutdown()` and `shutdownNow()` to manage the pool's state and terminate threads gracefully.

5. **Constructor Parameters:**
   The `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` constructors have several parameters:
   - `corePoolSize`: The core number of threads to keep in the pool.
   - `maximumPoolSize`: The maximum number of threads allowed in the pool.
   - `keepAliveTime`: The time excess idle threads wait before termination.
   - `unit`: The time unit for the keep-alive time.
   - `workQueue`: The queue to hold tasks awaiting execution.
   - `threadFactory`: The factory for creating new threads.
   - `handler`: The handler for rejected tasks.

Here's an example demonstrating some of these concepts:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.*;

public class ThreadPoolConfigExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int corePoolSize = 3;
        int maxPoolSize = 5;
        long keepAliveTime = 30;
        TimeUnit unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS;
        BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(10);
        ThreadFactory threadFactory = Executors.defaultThreadFactory();
        RejectedExecutionHandler handler = new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy();

        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
                corePoolSize, maxPoolSize, keepAliveTime, unit,
                workQueue, threadFactory, handler);

        for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            Runnable task = () -> {
                System.out.println("Task executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
            };
            executor.submit(task);
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this example, a `ThreadPoolExecutor` is created with specified core pool size, maximum pool size, keep-alive time, and other parameters. Tasks are submitted to the pool, and you can observe how the pool size, queue, and rejections behave based on the configured values.

Remember that the specific values for these parameters depend on your application's requirements, hardware, and concurrency needs. It's important to choose appropriate values to balance resource utilization, responsiveness, and efficiency.

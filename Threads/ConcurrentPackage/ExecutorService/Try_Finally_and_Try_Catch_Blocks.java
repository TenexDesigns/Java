Both `try-catch` blocks and `try-finally` blocks are used in Java for exception handling, but they serve different purposes. Let's explore their differences and use cases using code samples.

**Try-Catch Block:**
A `try-catch` block is used to catch and handle exceptions that might be thrown within the `try` block. If an exception occurs inside the `try` block, it's caught by the corresponding `catch` block, which allows you to handle the exception in a controlled manner.

```java
public class TryCatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int result = divide(10, 0); // Throws an ArithmeticException
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.err.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    public static int divide(int a, int b) {
        return a / b;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `divide()` method throws an `ArithmeticException` when dividing by zero. The `try-catch` block around the division catches the exception and prints an error message.

**Try-Finally Block:**
A `try-finally` block is used to ensure that certain code within the `finally` block executes regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not. It's often used for cleanup tasks or releasing resources.

```java
public class TryFinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            openResource(); // Opens a resource
            // Code that might throw exceptions
        } finally {
            closeResource(); // Closes the resource, even if an exception occurs
        }
    }

    public static void openResource() {
        System.out.println("Resource opened");
    }

    public static void closeResource() {
        System.out.println("Resource closed");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `openResource()` method opens a resource, and the `closeResource()` method is placed in the `finally` block to ensure that the resource is closed, regardless of whether an exception occurs.

**Choosing Between Try-Catch and Try-Finally:**
- Use a `try-catch` block when you want to handle exceptions and take specific actions based on the type of exception.
- Use a `try-finally` block when you want to ensure certain code (like resource cleanup) is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs.

**Combining Try-Catch and Try-Finally:**
You can also combine both blocks to handle exceptions and ensure cleanup:

```java
public class TryCatchFinallyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            openResource();
            int result = divide(10, 0); // Throws an ArithmeticException
            System.out.println("Result: " + result);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.err.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            closeResource();
        }
    }

    // Other methods same as previous examples
}
```

In this example, both the exception handling and resource cleanup are combined using `try-catch-finally`.

In summary, use `try-catch` blocks to handle exceptions and `try-finally` blocks to ensure certain code runs regardless of exceptions. You can also combine both blocks when necessary to handle exceptions and perform cleanup simultaneously.

Both `ReadWriteLock` and `ReentrantLock` are classes provided by Java's `java.util.concurrent.locks` package and serve as mechanisms for managing concurrency. However, they serve different purposes and are suited for different scenarios. Let's explore the differences between `ReadWriteLock` and `ReentrantLock`.

1. **ReentrantLock:**
   - `ReentrantLock` is a mutual exclusion (or mutex) lock that allows only one thread to acquire the lock at a time. It supports reentrant locking, which means that a thread can acquire the same lock multiple times without deadlocking.
   - It is used when you need exclusive access to a shared resource. It provides a fine-grained mechanism for controlling access to a critical section of code.
   - `ReentrantLock` offers advanced features such as fairness (ensuring the longest-waiting thread gets the lock) and support for `tryLock()` with timeouts.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class ReentrantLockExample {
    private static Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            // Critical section: Exclusive access to shared resource
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

2. **ReadWriteLock:**
   - `ReadWriteLock` is designed to manage read and write access to a shared resource more efficiently. It consists of two locks: a read lock and a write lock. Multiple threads can acquire the read lock simultaneously as long as no thread holds the write lock.
   - It is used when the shared resource can be read by multiple threads concurrently, but write access needs to be exclusive to avoid data inconsistency.
   - `ReadWriteLock` reduces contention between readers, which can lead to better performance in scenarios where reads are more frequent than writes.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class ReadWriteLockExample {
    private static ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

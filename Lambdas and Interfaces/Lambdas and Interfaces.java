In the context of Java, interfaces are indeed used for both classes and objects, but they serve a specific purpose in functional programming and lambda expressions. 
  Interfaces define a contract for classes, specifying what methods a class must implement.
  However, in the context of lambda expressions and functional programming, interfaces are used to define functional interfaces, which are interfaces with a single abstract method. 
  These interfaces are particularly useful for lambda expressions because they allow you to treat functions as first-class citizens in Java.

### Lambda Expressions and Interfaces

Lambda expressions in Java are a way to represent instances of single-method interfaces, such as `Consumer`, `Supplier`, `Function`, etc., in a concise manner. These interfaces are part of the `java.util.function` package and are designed to represent operations that can be applied to a single input and produce a result. The `Consumer` interface, for example, represents an operation that takes an input and returns no result, making it ideal for operations that perform actions on inputs, such as printing to the console.



  
### Example: Using `Consumer` Interface with Lambda Expressions

The provided code snippet demonstrates how to use the `Consumer` interface with a lambda expression to perform an action on each element of an `ArrayList`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- **Lambda Expression as `Consumer`**: The lambda expression `(n) -> { System.out.println(n); }` is assigned to a variable of type `Consumer<Integer>`. This lambda expression takes an integer `n` as input and prints it to the console. The lambda expression implicitly implements the `Consumer` interface by matching its single abstract method, `accept(T t)`, which takes an input and performs an action on it.

- **Using `forEach` with `Consumer`**: The `ArrayList`s `forEach` method is called with the `Consumer` lambda expression as an argument. This method applies the `Consumer`'s `accept` method (i.e., the lambda expression) to each element in the list, effectively printing each number in the list to the console.

### Other Interfaces Like `Consumer`

Java provides several other functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, each designed for a specific type of operation:

- **`Supplier<T>`**: Represents a supplier of results, taking no arguments and returning a result.
- **`Function<T,R>`**: Represents a function that takes an argument and produces a result.
- **`Predicate<T>`**: Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.

These interfaces, along with `Consumer`, are foundational to functional programming in Java, enabling concise and expressive code for operations that can be represented as functions.

### Conclusion

Interfaces in Java, especially functional interfaces like `Consumer`, play a crucial role in functional programming and lambda expressions. They allow for the definition of operations as first-class citizens, enabling more expressive and concise code. The use of lambda expressions with these interfaces simplifies the implementation of operations that take a single input and produce a result, making it easier to work with collections and other data structures in Java.

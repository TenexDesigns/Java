Yes, in Java, classes are fundamental building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each class typically resides in its own file, with the file name matching the class name. So yes, you'd often create a new file for each new class you create.

In Java, classes are organized into packages. Packages are namespaces that help you group related classes together. This helps in organizing your codebase and avoids naming conflicts. You can also use access modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected` to control the visibility of classes within and outside of packages.

Java is indeed still relevant today, especially in enterprise software development and Android app development. While newer technologies like Flutter and Node.js have gained popularity, Java still holds a strong position in various domains.

Here are some areas where Java is commonly used today:

1. **Enterprise Software**: Many large-scale applications and systems in banking, insurance, healthcare, and other industries are built using Java.
2. **Android Development**: Java remains one of the primary languages for Android app development, although Kotlin is also gaining popularity.
3. **Web Development**: While not as dominant as it once was, Java is still used in web development, particularly in backend systems, with frameworks like Spring and Java EE.
4. **Big Data**: Java is commonly used in big data processing frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
5. **Financial Services**: Java is extensively used in the financial industry for building trading platforms, risk management systems, and other applications.

In terms of technologies or areas within Java that are likely to help you get a job:

1. **Spring Framework**: Spring is a widely used framework for building enterprise Java applications. Knowledge of Spring, including Spring Boot for microservices, is highly valued.
2. **Java Persistence API (JPA) and Hibernate**: These are commonly used for database access and object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java applications.
3. **Android Development**: If you're interested in mobile app development, learning Java for Android development can open up job opportunities.
4. **Microservices**: With the rise of microservices architecture, understanding how to build and deploy Java microservices using tools like Spring Boot is valuable.
5. **Cloud Technologies**: Familiarity with cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, and how Java applications can be deployed and managed on them, can enhance your job prospects.

Overall, while there are newer technologies emerging, Java's stability, performance, and extensive ecosystem ensure its continued relevance in the software development industry.

  .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Example of findFirst
Employee firstEmployee = Stream.of(empIds)
  .map(employeeRepository::findById)
  .filter(e -> e != null)
  .filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 100000)
  .findFirst()
  .orElse(null);

Comparison-Based Stream Operations:

Demonstrates sorting using the sorted() operation.
Shows how to use min, max, and distinct operations.
Introduces operations like allMatch, anyMatch, and noneMatch for checking conditions.

Demonstrating sorting using the sorted() operation, using min, max, and distinct operations, and showing the use of allMatch, anyMatch, and noneMatch for checking conditions.

java
Copy code
// Example of sorted
List<Employee> sortedEmployees = empList.stream()
  .sorted((e1, e2) -> e1.getName().compareTo(e2.getName()))
  .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Example of min
Employee minSalaryEmployee = empList.stream()
  .min(Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary))
  .orElseThrow(NoSuchElementException::new);

// Example of distinct
List<Integer> distinctIntegers = intList.stream()
  .distinct()
  .collect(Collectors.toList());

// Example of allMatch, anyMatch, noneMatch
boolean allEven = intList.stream().allMatch(i -> i % 2 == 0);
boolean oneEven = intList.stream().anyMatch(i -> i % 2 == 0);
boolean noneMultipleOfThree = intList.stream().noneMatch(i -> i % 3 == 

Java Stream Specializations:

Explains specialized streams like IntStream, LongStream, and DoubleStream.
Examples of creating and using specialized streams.
Clarification that these specialized streams do not extend the standard Stream interface.


Introducing specialized streams like IntStream, LongStream, and DoubleStream, explaining their purpose and demonstrating their creation and use.

java
Copy code
// Example of using IntStream
Integer latestEmpId = empList.stream()
  .mapToInt(Employee::getId)
  .max()
  .orElseThrow(NoSuchElementException::new);

// Example of using LongStream
Long sumOfSalaries = empList.stream()
  .mapToLong(Employee::getSalary)
  .sum();

// Example of using DoubleStream
Double averageSalary = empList.stream()
  .mapToDouble(Employee::getSalary)
  .average()
  .orElseThrow(NoSuchElementException::new);


Advanced Collect:

Demonstrates advanced collecting using joining, toSet, toCollection, summarizingDouble, summaryStatistics, partitioningBy, groupingBy, mapping, and reducing.
Shows how to use these collectors for complex data aggregation and summarization.

Demonstrating advanced collecting operations like joining, toSet, toCollection, summarizingDouble, partitioningBy, groupingBy, mapping, and reducing.

java
Copy code
// Example of joining
String empNames = empList.stream()
  .map(Employee::getName)
  .collect(Collectors.joining(", "));

// Example of toSet
Set<String> empNameSet = empList.stream()
  .map(Employee::getName)
  .collect(Collectors.toSet());

// Example of summarizingDouble
DoubleSummaryStatistics salaryStats = empList.stream()
  .collect(Collectors.summarizingDouble(Employee::getSalary));

// Example of groupingBy
Map<Character, List<Employee>> groupByAlphabet = empList.stream()
  .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(e -> e.getName().charAt(0)));

Parallel Streams:

Introduces the concept of parallel streams for performing operations in parallel.
Explains considerations when using parallel streams, such as thread-safety and order.

Explaining the concept of parallel streams for parallel execution, emphasizing thread-safety, and providing an example of parallel stream usage.

java
Copy code
// Example of using parallel stream
empList.parallelStream().forEach(e -> e.salaryIncrement(10.0));



Infinite Streams:

Shows how to generate infinite streams using generate and iterate.
Emphasizes using terminal operations like limit to ensure termination.
Points out that some operations may not work well with infinite streams.

Explaining the concept of infinite streams using generate and iterate, showing how to terminate with operations like limit, and cautioning about some operations with infinite streams.

The `Stream.of()` method is a convenient static method provided by Java's `java.util.stream.Stream` class. It is used to create a stream from a set of specified elements. Each element you pass as an argument to `Stream.of()` becomes an element in the resulting stream.

Here's the basic syntax:

```java
Stream<T> stream = Stream.of(element1, element2, ..., elementN);
```

Where `T` is the type of the elements being passed to the stream, and `element1`, `element2`, etc. are the actual elements that you want to include in the stream.

For example, in your previous code snippet:

```java
Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "ten");
```

This creates a stream of strings containing the elements "one", "two", "three", and so on.

Other than `Stream.of()`, there are additional methods for creating streams and working with them:

1. `Collection.stream()` or `Collection.parallelStream()`: These methods are available on various collection classes (such as `List`, `Set`, `Map`) and allow you to create a stream from the elements in the collection.

2. `Arrays.stream(array)`: This method is used to create a stream from an array of elements.

3. `Stream.generate(Supplier<T> supplier)`: Creates an infinite stream by repeatedly invoking the provided `Supplier` to generate elements.

4. `Stream.iterate(T seed, UnaryOperator<T> f)`: Creates an infinite stream by repeatedly applying the provided function to the previous element.

These methods, along with the `Stream.of()`, provide different ways to create streams from various sources and are central to working with Java streams to process data in a functional and concise manner.

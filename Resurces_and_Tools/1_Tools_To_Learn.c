**Spring in Java Development:**
Spring is a popular open-source framework for building Java applications. It provides a comprehensive infrastructure that supports various aspects of application development, including dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, data access, web applications, and more. Spring simplifies the development process by promoting modularization and maintainability of code. The core concept in Spring is Inversion of Control (IoC), which allows you to manage and inject dependencies more effectively.

In the context of functional programming, when we refer to "immutable data," we mean that the values contained within an object cannot be changed after the object is created. This is achieved by ensuring that the state of an object remains constant throughout its lifetime.

In Java, the `final` keyword is often used to enforce immutability. However, using `final` alone does not make an object fully immutable; it only prevents reassignment of the reference to that object. To achieve true immutability, you need to ensure that the internal state of the object cannot be modified.

Here's what we mean by immutable data in the context of functional programming:

1. **Immutable Object:** An immutable object is an object whose internal state (i.e., its fields) cannot be changed after the object is created. This means that the values of the fields remain constant.

2. **Creating New Instances:** Instead of modifying an existing object's fields, you create a new object with updated values. This avoids modifying shared state and ensures that each instance of the object remains unchanged.

3. **Predictable Behavior:** Immutable objects are predictable because they cannot be modified by multiple threads simultaneously. This makes reasoning about code easier, especially in concurrent scenarios.

Here's an example using Java's `String` class, which is an example of an immutable class:

```java
public class ImmutableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String original = "Hello";
        String modified = original.concat(", World"); // Creates a new string

        System.out.println(original);   // Prints "Hello"
        System.out.println(modified);   // Prints "Hello, World"
    }
}
```

In this example, the `concat` method creates a new `String` instance containing the concatenated value. The original `String` remains unchanged.

While using the `final` keyword and ensuring immutability are related concepts, true immutability goes beyond just marking variables as `final`. It involves designing classes in such a way that their internal state cannot be modified after construction. This practice aligns well with the principles of functional programming, making code more predictable and easier to reason about.

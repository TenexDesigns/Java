Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. Java has incorporated functional programming concepts since Java 8 with the introduction of lambda expressions and the Stream API. Here are some key features and concepts of functional programming in Java:

1. **Lambda Expressions:**
   Lambda expressions allow you to define small, inline functions. They are particularly useful for writing more concise and expressive code. Lambda expressions are often used when working with functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method).

   Example:
   ```java
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
   names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
   ```

2. **Functional Interfaces:**
   These are interfaces that have only one abstract method. Functional interfaces can be implemented using lambda expressions or method references. Java provides several built-in functional interfaces like `Function`, `Predicate`, and `Consumer`.

   Example:
   ```java
   Function<Integer, Integer> square = x -> x * x;
   Predicate<Integer> isEven = x -> x % 2 == 0;
   Consumer<String> printer = s -> System.out.println(s);
   ```

3. **Stream API:**
   The Stream API provides a way to process sequences of elements in a functional style. Streams allow you to perform various operations like filtering, mapping, reducing, and more on collections in a concise and efficient manner.

   Example:
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
   int sum = numbers.stream()
                   .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                   .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                   .sum();
   ```

4. **Method References:**
   Method references allow you to refer to methods by their names. They can often replace lambda expressions for improved readability.

   Example:
   ```java
   List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
   names.forEach(System.out::println);
   ```

5. **Immutable Data:**
   In functional programming, data is typically immutable, meaning that once a value is assigned, it cannot be changed. This can lead to more predictable and thread-safe code.

   Example:
   ```java
   final String name = "Alice"; // Immutable variable
   ```

6. **Pure Functions:**
   Pure functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. They are a fundamental concept in functional programming.

   Example:
   ```java
   int add(int a, int b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

7. **Functional Programming Libraries:**
   Libraries like Vavr (formerly known as Javaslang) provide additional functional programming features for Java, including immutable data types, pattern matching, and more advanced functional constructs.

Java's support for functional programming allows you to write code that is more declarative, concise, and often easier to reason about. It encourages separating concerns and can lead to code that is more modular and maintainable.

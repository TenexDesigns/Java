Java's functional programming features have evolved over different versions of the language. Here are some key features related to functional programming in Java:

**1. Lambda Expressions:**
Lambda expressions provide a concise way to express instances of functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method). They enable you to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data. Lambda expressions are used for creating anonymous functions.

Example:
```java
Function<Integer, Integer> square = x -> x * x;
```

**2. Functional Interfaces:**
Functional interfaces are interfaces that have exactly one abstract method. Java provides several built-in functional interfaces like `Function`, `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`, and more.

Example:
```java
interface Predicate<T> {
    boolean test(T t);
}
```

**3. Method References:**
Method references allow you to refer to methods or constructors by their names. They can be used to point to methods and use them as lambda expressions.

Example:
```java
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob");
names.forEach(System.out::println);
```

**4. Streams API:**
The Streams API provides a way to process sequences of elements (such as collections) in a functional-style manner. You can use methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and others to perform data transformations.

Example:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream()
                .filter(x -> x % 2 == 0)
                .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
                .sum();
```

**5. Optional:**
The `Optional` class represents a container that may or may not contain a non-null value. It encourages handling null values in a more functional and less error-prone way.

Example:
```java
Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(getName());
String upperCaseName = name.map(String::toUpperCase).orElse("Unknown");
```

**6. Default and Static Methods in Interfaces:**
Default and static methods in interfaces allow for more flexibility and ease of use in functional programming. Default methods provide a default implementation for an interface method, while static methods can be called directly on the interface.

Example:
```java
interface MathOperation {
    int operate(int a, int b);
    
    static MathOperation multiply() {
        return (a, b) -> a * b;
    }
}
```

**7. forEach Loop on Iterable:**
Java 8 introduced the `forEach` loop on `Iterable` interfaces, making it easier to iterate over collections.

Example:
```java
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.forEach(System.out::println);
```

These features collectively make Java a more expressive and functional programming language, allowing developers to write cleaner, more concise, and more maintainable code.

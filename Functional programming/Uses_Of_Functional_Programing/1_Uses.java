Sure, let's go through each of the scenarios you mentioned and see how functional programming concepts are used to address the challenges:

1. **Data Transformation:**
   Functional programming is used to transform data using operations like mapping, filtering, and reducing. The Streams API in Java is a prime example of this. Consider the following code snippet that transforms a list of strings:

   ```java
   List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David");
   
   List<String> uppercaseNames = names.stream()
       .map(String::toUpperCase)  // Mapping operation
       .collect(Collectors.toList());  // Collecting the result
   
   System.out.println(uppercaseNames);
   ```

   In this example, the `map` operation transforms each name to uppercase, and the `collect` operation collects the result in a new list.

2. **Concurrency and Parallelism:**
   Functional programming helps simplify concurrency and parallelism by avoiding shared state and providing a clearer separation of concerns. Java's Streams API can be used in parallel to process data concurrently without the need for explicit synchronization. This can lead to more efficient use of multi-core processors. Here's an example:

   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);
   
   long sum = numbers.parallelStream()
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)  // Filtering operation (concurrent)
       .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)
       .sum();  // Reduction operation (concurrent)
   
   System.out.println("Sum of even numbers: " + sum);
   ```

   In this example, the `filter` and `sum` operations are performed concurrently on multiple threads.

3. **Callbacks and Event Handling:**
   Functional programming can make callbacks and event handling more concise and readable, especially when using lambda expressions. This is particularly useful in scenarios like handling asynchronous tasks or responding to events. Here's an example of using callbacks with functional programming:

   ```java
   interface EventListener {
       void onEvent(String event);
   }
   
   class EventPublisher {
       private List<EventListener> listeners = new ArrayList<>();
   
       void addListener(EventListener listener) {
           listeners.add(listener);
       }
   
       void fireEvent(String event) {
           listeners.forEach(listener -> listener.onEvent(event));
       }
   }
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       EventPublisher publisher = new EventPublisher();
       
       publisher.addListener(event -> System.out.println("Received event: " + event));
       
       publisher.fireEvent("Data updated");
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `addListener` method accepts a lambda expression as a callback to handle events.

4. **Algorithmic Complexity:**
   Functional programming can provide clearer and more elegant solutions for problems involving recursion and complex data transformations. Functional programming languages often offer powerful constructs for recursion and pattern matching. Here's a simple recursive factorial example in Java using functional programming:

   ```java
   Function<Integer, Integer> factorial = n ->
       n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial.apply(n - 1);
   
   int result = factorial.apply(5);
   System.out.println("Factorial of 5: " + result);
   ```

   In this example, the `factorial` function uses a self-referential lambda to calculate the factorial recursively.

Functional programming helps in these scenarios by providing a cleaner, more expressive way to solve problems using immutable data and higher-order functions, resulting in code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

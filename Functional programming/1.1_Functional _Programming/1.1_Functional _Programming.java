Functional programming in Java involves using functions as first-class citizens, allowing functions to be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. While Java is primarily an object-oriented language, it has introduced functional programming features since Java 8, such as lambda expressions and the Stream API, which enable a more functional style of programming.

Here are some key features of functional programming in Java:

1. **Lambda Expressions:** Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions. They allow you to treat behavior as data, enabling functional programming constructs like higher-order functions.

   Example:
   ```java
   // Syntax: (parameters) -> expression
   Function<Integer, Integer> square = (x) -> x * x;
   ```

2. **Functional Interfaces:** Functional interfaces are interfaces that contain exactly one abstract method. They are used to define the signature of lambda expressions. Java provides many built-in functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, such as `Function`, `Predicate`, `Consumer`, and `Supplier`.

   Example:
   ```java
   // Function interface representing a function that accepts an integer and returns a boolean
   Predicate<Integer> isPositive = (x) -> x > 0;
   ```

3. **Streams API:** The Streams API allows for declarative, functional-style operations on collections. It provides methods for filtering, mapping, reducing, and iterating over elements of a collection in a functional manner.

   Example:
   ```java
   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
   numbers.stream()
          .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
          .map(n -> n * n)
          .forEach(System.out::println);
   ```

4. **Method References:** Method references provide a way to refer to methods without invoking them. They can be used in place of lambda expressions when the lambda expression simply calls an existing method.

   Example:
   ```java
   // Method reference to the static method Integer::parseInt
   Function<String, Integer> parser = Integer::parseInt;
   ```

5. **Immutable Data:** Functional programming encourages immutability, where data, once created, cannot be modified. In Java, this can be achieved by using `final` variables and immutable classes like `String` and `BigInteger`.

   Example:
   ```java
   final List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
   ```

By leveraging these features, developers can write more concise, readable, and maintainable code in Java, embracing the principles of functional programming alongside object-oriented programming.

A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method.
  Functional interfaces are a fundamental concept in Java's functional programming paradigm. They are also sometimes referred to as Single Abstract Method (SAM) interfaces. The idea behind functional interfaces is to provide a way to represent a specific piece of functionality as a type, allowing you to treat functions as first-class citizens in Java.

Here's a breakdown of what this means:

1. **Single Abstract Method (SAM):**
   A functional interface should have only one abstract method. Other than the abstract method, it can contain default methods, static methods, and methods inherited from the `Object` class.

2. **First-Class Citizens:**
   In functional programming, functions are treated as values. By representing functionality as types (functional interfaces), Java allows you to pass functions as arguments to methods, return them from methods, and store them in variables.

3. **Built-In Functional Interfaces:**
   Java provides a set of built-in functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package. These interfaces cover common use cases for functional programming and are designed to work seamlessly with lambda expressions.

   - `Function<T, R>`: Represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and returns a result of type `R`.
   - `Predicate<T>`: Represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and returns a boolean result.
   - `Consumer<T>`: Represents a function that takes an argument of type `T` and performs an action without returning a result.
   - `Supplier<T>`: Represents a function that does not take any arguments but returns a result of type `T`.

Here's an example of using a functional interface, `Function`, to double a list of integers:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.function.Function;

public class FunctionalInterfaceExample {
    public static List<Integer> mapList(List<Integer> list, Function<Integer, Integer> mapper) {
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
            list.set(i, mapper.apply(list.get(i)));
        }
        return list;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        List<Integer> doubledNumbers = mapList(numbers, x -> x * 2);
        System.out.println(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    }
}
```

In this example, `Function<Integer, Integer>` is a functional interface that represents a function taking an `Integer` argument and returning an `Integer` result. The `mapList` method accepts a `Function` as an argument and applies it to each element of the list.

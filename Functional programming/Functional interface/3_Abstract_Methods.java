An abstract method in Java is a method declared in an interface or an abstract class that doesn't have an implementation within that interface or abstract class.
  The implementation of the method is provided by the concrete class that implements the interface or extends the abstract class.
  Abstract methods serve as placeholders for the behavior that must be implemented by the subclasses.

Here's an example to illustrate abstract methods in Intefaces and Abstarct classes:


  1_ Intefaces 

  // Interface with an abstract method
interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // Abstract method without implementation
}

// Concrete classes that implement the interface
class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}


2_ Classes
  

```java
// Abstract class with an abstract method
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double calculateArea(); // Abstract method without implementation
}

// Concrete class that extends the abstract class and implements the abstract method
class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class AbstractMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Circle circle = new Circle(5.0);
        System.out.println("Area of the circle: " + circle.calculateArea());
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Shape` class is an abstract class that declares an abstract method `calculateArea()`. This method doesn't have a body; it's just a declaration.
- The `Circle` class is a concrete class that extends the `Shape` abstract class and provides an implementation for the `calculateArea()` method.
- In the `main` method, an instance of `Circle` is created, and the `calculateArea()` method is called to calculate and display the area of the circle.

Abstract methods provide a way to define a contract that concrete classes must adhere to. Subclasses that inherit an abstract method are required to provide an implementation for that method. This enables you to create a common interface for different subclasses while allowing each subclass to implement its own specific behavior.







ABSTACT METHODS IN INTEFACES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract methods in interfaces are similar to those in abstract classes. An abstract method declared in an interface is a method that doesn't have an implementation within the interface itself. Concrete classes that implement the interface must provide an implementation for these abstract methods.

Here's an example of abstract methods in interfaces:

```java
// Interface with an abstract method
interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // Abstract method without implementation
}

// Concrete classes that implement the interface
class Dog implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class InterfaceAbstractMethodExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Dog();
        Animal cat = new Cat();

        dog.makeSound(); // Outputs: Dog barks
        cat.makeSound(); // Outputs: Cat meows
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Animal` interface declares an abstract method `makeSound()`. This method is abstract because it's declared without an implementation.
- The `Dog` and `Cat` classes implement the `Animal` interface and provide implementations for the `makeSound()` method.
- In the `main` method, instances of `Dog` and `Cat` are created, and the `makeSound()` method is called on each instance to produce the respective animal sounds.

Interfaces allow you to define contracts that classes must follow. Any class implementing an interface with abstract methods is required to provide implementations for those methods. This allows you to achieve abstraction and polymorphism in your codebase.

The syntax `Function<Double, Double>` represents a functional interface in Java that takes a `Double` as input and returns a `Double` as output. Let's break down the syntax:

- `Function`: This is the name of the functional interface. It's part of the `java.util.function` package and represents a function that takes an argument of one type and produces a result of another type.
- `<Double, Double>`: These are the type parameters for the `Function` interface. The first `Double` represents the input type (argument type), and the second `Double` represents the output type (result type).

So, `Function<Double, Double>` specifies a functional interface that defines a function taking a `Double` as input and producing a `Double` as output.

Here's how you might use this functional interface:

```java
import java.util.function.Function;

public class FunctionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define a function that doubles a Double value
        Function<Double, Double> doubleFunction = x -> x * 2.0;

        // Apply the function to a Double value
        Double result = doubleFunction.apply(3.0);
        System.out.println(result); // Outputs: 6.0
    }
}
```

In this example, `doubleFunction` is an instance of the `Function<Double, Double>` interface. It takes a `Double` as input and returns a `Double` by doubling the input value. The `apply` method is called on the function instance to apply the doubling operation to the input value (`3.0`), resulting in the output value `6.0`.

This syntax is part of Java's functional programming features and allows you to work with functions as first-class citizens, passing them around, composing them, and applying them to data.

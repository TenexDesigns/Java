Yes, lambda expressions in Java are a way to define anonymous functions or methods. An anonymous function is a function that doesn't have a name associated with it, and it's often used as a parameter to other functions or for defining behavior within a specific context.

In the context of Java's lambda expressions:

1. **Anonymous Function with Lambda Expression:**
Lambda expressions allow you to define anonymous functions without explicitly giving them a name. Instead, you define the behavior of the function inline.

Here's an example of an anonymous function defined using a lambda expression to implement the `Runnable` interface:
```java
Runnable anonymousFunction = () -> System.out.println("Hello from an anonymous function!");
```

2. **Anonymous Method with Lambda Expression:**
When you use a lambda expression to implement a functional interface, you're essentially defining an anonymous method that implements the single abstract method of that interface.

For example, consider the `Comparator` functional interface:
```java
Comparator<String> comparator = (s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2);
```
In this case, the lambda expression `(s1, s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2)` is implementing the `compare` method of the `Comparator` interface, and it's an anonymous method.

Lambda expressions are a concise way to create these anonymous functions or methods, making your code more expressive and allowing you to pass behavior as arguments to other methods or use them within functional programming constructs.

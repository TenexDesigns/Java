**1. Mutable State:**
Mutable state refers to data that can be changed after it's been created. This can lead to unintended side effects and make code harder to understand and reason about, especially in concurrent environments. Functional programming encourages the use of immutable data to avoid these issues.

**Example with Mutable State:**
```java
public class MutableStateExample {
    private int counter = 0;

    public void incrementCounter() {
        counter++;
    }

    public int getCounter() {
        return counter;
    }
}
```

**Drawbacks and Unadvantages:**
- Shared mutable state can lead to race conditions and concurrency issues.
- Code using mutable state can be harder to test and debug.
- Mutable state can make reasoning about program behavior more complex.

**Functional Approach to Avoid Mutable State:**
```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class FunctionalMutableStateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum = IntStream.rangeClosed(1, 5)
            .sum();
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

**Advantages of the Functional Approach:**
- Using immutable values eliminates the possibility of unexpected side effects.
- Code becomes more predictable, easier to parallelize, and safer for concurrent use.
- Functional programming promotes a more declarative and concise coding style.

**2. Explicit Looping:**
Explicit loops like `for` and `while` can make code harder to read and understand. In functional programming, you're encouraged to use higher-level operations like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` for data processing.

**Example with Explicit Looping:**
```java
public class LoopingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

**Drawbacks and Unadvantages:**
- Explicit loops can lead to verbose and error-prone code.
- Code readability can suffer as loop logic becomes more complex.

**Functional Approach to Avoid Explicit Looping:**
```java
import java.util.List;

public class FunctionalLoopingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        int sum = numbers.stream()
            .reduce(0, Integer::sum);
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

**Advantages of the Functional Approach:**
- Functional-style operations make code more concise and declarative.
- Operations like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are easier to read and understand.
- Functional programming encourages a focus on what to do rather than how to do it.

**3. Shared State:**
Shared state refers to data that is accessible and modifiable by multiple parts of a program. This can lead to concurrency issues and non-deterministic behavior, especially in multi-threaded scenarios.

**Example with Shared State:**
```java
public class SharedStateExample {
    private int counter = 0;

    public void incrementCounter() {
        counter++;
    }

    public int getCounter() {
        return counter;
    }
}
```

**Drawbacks and Unadvantages:**
- Shared state can lead to race conditions, where multiple threads access and modify data simultaneously.
- Debugging and fixing concurrency issues can be challenging and time-consuming.
- Code using shared state can be difficult to reason about and predict.

**Functional Approach to Avoid Shared State:**
```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class FunctionalSharedStateExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
        counter.incrementAndGet();
        System.out.println("Counter: " + counter.get());
    }
}
```

**Advantages of the Functional Approach:**
- Using thread-safe constructs like `AtomicInteger` ensures safe concurrent access.
- Functional programming encourages a more modular and isolated approach to data manipulation.
- Avoiding shared state helps prevent hard-to-diagnose concurrency bugs.

In summary, functional programming techniques encourage a more modular, predictable, and safer approach to writing code by avoiding mutable state, leveraging higher-level operations for data processing, and minimizing shared state to prevent concurrency issues.

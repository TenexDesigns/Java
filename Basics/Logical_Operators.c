In Java, logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean expressions. These operators allow you to combine or modify boolean values to make decisions or control the flow of your program. Java provides three main logical operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT). Here's how they work:

1. **AND Operator (`&&`)**:
   - The `&&` operator returns `true` if both operands are `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`.
   - It short-circuits the evaluation, meaning that if the left operand is `false`, the right operand is not evaluated because the overall result is already known.

```java
boolean condition1 = true;
boolean condition2 = false;

boolean result = condition1 && condition2; // result is false
```

2. **OR Operator (`||`)**:
   - The `||` operator returns `true` if at least one of the operands is `true`, otherwise, it returns `false`.
   - Like the `&&` operator, it also short-circuits the evaluation.

```java
boolean condition1 = true;
boolean condition2 = false;

boolean result = condition1 || condition2; // result is true
```

3. **NOT Operator (`!`)**:
   - The `!` operator is a unary operator that negates a boolean value. If the operand is `true`, `!` returns `false`; if the operand is `false`, `!` returns `true`.

```java
boolean condition = true;

boolean result = !condition; // result is false
```

These logical operators can be combined to create more complex boolean expressions. For example:

```java
boolean a = true;
boolean b = false;
boolean c = true;

boolean result = (a && b) || (c && !b); // result is true
```

Logical operators are commonly used in conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`), loop control (`while`, `for`), and other situations where you need to make decisions based on boolean conditions. They allow you to create expressive and flexible logic in your Java programs.

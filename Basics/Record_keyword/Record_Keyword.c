The `record` keyword in Java was introduced in Java 16 as a new feature to simplify the creation of classes that are primarily used for holding and managing data. It's designed to automatically generate common methods like constructors, equals(), hashCode(), and toString(), based on the fields defined in the record.

Here's how the `record` keyword is used:

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
}
```

In this example, the `record` keyword is used to create a class named `Person` with two fields: `name` of type `String` and `age` of type `int`. The compiler will automatically generate a constructor to initialize these fields, as well as implementations for the `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.

Here's a breakdown of what the `record` keyword does:

1. **Constructor Generation:** The compiler generates a constructor that takes parameters for each field and assigns them to the corresponding fields. In the above example, a constructor with `(String name, int age)` parameters is automatically created.

2. **Getters:** Getters for each field are automatically generated. In the example, you can access the `name` and `age` fields using the `getName()` and `getAge()` methods, respectively.

3. **equals() and hashCode():** The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are automatically implemented based on the fields. Two instances of the same record class with the same field values will be considered equal.

4. **toString():** The `toString()` method is automatically implemented to provide a string representation of the record's fields.

Example usage:

```java
Person person = new Person("Alice", 25);
System.out.println(person.getName()); // Alice
System.out.println(person.getAge());  // 25
System.out.println(person);           // Person[name=Alice, age=25]
```

Keep in mind:

- Fields in a record are implicitly `final`.
- You cannot extend another class while using the `record` keyword.
- You can customize the behavior of methods by providing your own implementations, but this is less common and may reduce the benefits of using records.

Records are particularly useful for simple data-holding classes, where the focus is on data storage and manipulation rather than complex business logic. They help reduce boilerplate code and make the codebase more concise and readable.

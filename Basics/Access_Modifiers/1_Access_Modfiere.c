In Java, access modifiers are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, fields, and other members within your code. There are four main access modifiers in Java:

1. **public**: Members declared as `public` are accessible from any other class or package. There is no access restriction.

2. **private**: Members declared as `private` are only accessible within the same class. They cannot be accessed from other classes, even if they are in the same package.

3. **protected**: Members declared as `protected` are accessible within the same package and also in subclasses (even if the subclass is in a different package).

4. **default (no modifier)**: If no access modifier is specified, the member has package-level visibility. This means it can be accessed only within the same package.

Heres how these access modifiers are used in various contexts:

**Class Access Modifiers**:
```java
public class PublicClass {}        // Accessible from anywhere
class DefaultClass {}             // Accessible only within the same package
```

**Field Access Modifiers**:
```java
public int publicField;           // Accessible from anywhere
private int privateField;         // Accessible only within the same class
protected int protectedField;     // Accessible within the same package and subclasses
int defaultField;                 // Accessible only within the same package
```

**Method Access Modifiers**:
```java
public void publicMethod() {}     // Accessible from anywhere
private void privateMethod() {}   // Accessible only within the same class
protected void protectedMethod() {} // Accessible within the same package and subclasses
void defaultMethod() {}           // Accessible only within the same package
```

**Constructor Access Modifiers**:
```java
public ClassName() {}             // Accessible from anywhere
private ClassName() {}            // Accessible only within the same class
```

**Nested Class Access Modifiers**:
```java
public class Outer {
    public class PublicInner {}    // Accessible from anywhere
    private class PrivateInner {}  // Accessible only within the same class
    protected class ProtectedInner {} // Accessible within the same package and subclasses
    class DefaultInner {}          // Accessible only within the same package
}
```

Its important to choose the appropriate access modifier based on the intended visibility and encapsulation of your classes and members. Using access modifiers effectively helps ensure proper data encapsulation and maintainability of your code.

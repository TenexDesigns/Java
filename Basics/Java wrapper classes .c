Wrapper classes in Java are classes that provide a way to use primitive data types as objects. They "wrap" the primitive values in an object representation, allowing them to be used in a more object-oriented context. Each primitive data type has a corresponding wrapper class. The primary purpose of wrapper classes is to provide utility methods, enable compatibility with collections and other APIs that require objects, and to facilitate certain programming paradigms.

Here are the primitive data types and their corresponding wrapper classes:

| Primitive | Wrapper    |
| --------- | ---------- |
| boolean   | Boolean    |
| char      | Character  |
| byte      | Byte       |
| short     | Short      |
| int       | Integer    |
| long      | Long       |
| float     | Float      |
| double    | Double     |

**Pros and Cons of Using Wrapper Classes:**

**Pros:**

1. **Object-Oriented Usage:** Wrapper classes allow primitive types to be used in an object-oriented context, providing access to useful methods and enabling their use in APIs that require objects.

2. **Compatibility:** Wrapper classes are used in various Java APIs, libraries, and collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) which only work with objects.

3. **Nullability:** Wrapper classes can hold `null` values, which primitives cannot. This can be useful in certain scenarios.

**Cons:**

1. **Memory Overhead:** Wrapper classes consume more memory than their corresponding primitive types due to the overhead of the object structure.

2. **Performance Impact:** Operations involving wrapper classes can be slower compared to primitives due to the need for object instantiation and method invocations.

3. **Autoboxing/Unboxing Overhead:** Autoboxing (converting a primitive to its wrapper) and unboxing (converting a wrapper to its primitive) can add overhead and impact performance.

**Autoboxing and Unboxing:**

Autoboxing and unboxing are features in Java that automatically convert between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes. Autoboxing is the process of automatically converting a primitive value to its wrapper object when needed, and unboxing is the process of automatically converting a wrapper object back to its primitive value when needed.

```java
// Autoboxing
Integer i = 42;  // int to Integer

// Unboxing
int j = i;       // Integer to int
```

While autoboxing and unboxing can simplify code by eliminating the need for manual conversions, they can also introduce performance overhead, especially in cases where they are frequently used within loops or performance-critical sections of code.

In summary, wrapper classes provide a bridge between primitive data types and object-oriented programming in Java. They enable the use of primitive types in contexts where objects are required, such as collections and APIs, but come with some trade-offs in terms of memory usage and performance. Autoboxing and unboxing are convenient features that automatically handle conversions between primitives and wrappers, but care should be taken in performance-critical scenarios.

Java provides a set of wrapper classes in the `java.lang` package to help us use primitive data types as reference data types. These classes encapsulate a primitive value in an object. Hence, they are called wrapper classes. Each of Java's eight primitive data types has a corresponding wrapper class [Source 4](https://www.javatpoint.com/wrapper-class-in-java).

Here are the primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes:

- boolean: Boolean
- byte: Byte
- char: Character
- short: Short
- int: Integer
- long: Long
- float: Float
- double: Double

**Primitive vs. Reference Types:**

1. **Primitive types:** They are the basic types of data: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char. Primitive types are stored on the stack and are faster to access. They hold the actual value rather than a reference to an object.

2. **Reference types:** They are created using defined constructors of the classes. They are used to access objects. These variables are declared to be of a specific type that cannot be changed. Reference types are stored in the heap, which provides a lot more space for storing data.

**Pros and Cons:**

1. **Primitive types:** They are faster to access and require less memory. However, they have no methods or fields and can't be used in collections.

2. **Reference types (Wrapper classes):** They can be used with collections and have methods and fields that provide added functionality. However, they require more memory and are slower to access.

**Autoboxing and Unboxing:**

Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of primitive types to their corresponding object wrapper classes. For example, converting int to Integer. Unboxing is the reverse process, where the object of a wrapper type is automatically converted to its corresponding primitive type. For example, converting Integer to int. This allows primitive types and wrapper classes to be used interchangeably, making the code cleaner and easier to read [Source 3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/autoboxing-unboxing-java/).

Heres an example of autoboxing and unboxing:

```java
// Autoboxing
Integer wrappedInt = 7; // Compiler auto-boxes

// Unboxing
int primitiveInt = wrappedInt; // Compiler auto-unboxes
```

Note that autoboxing and unboxing happen automatically, and you dont need to do anything special to use them [Source 6](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34173337/what-is-difference-between-wrapper-and-auto-boxing-unboxing-in-java).

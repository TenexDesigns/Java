In Java, you can copy objects using various techniques, each serving different purposes. The most common methods for copying objects are:

1. **Shallow Copy**:
   A shallow copy of an object copies all the fields of the object to a new object. However, if the field is a reference to an object (e.g., another object, array, or collection), the reference itself is copied, not the referenced object. As a result, the original object and the copied object will still share the same referenced objects.

   Shallow copying can be done using copy constructors or cloning.

2. **Deep Copy**:
   A deep copy of an object copies all the fields of the object, including the referenced objects, recursively. This creates entirely new copies of all the objects referenced by the original object, ensuring that the copied object is fully independent of the original object.

   Deep copying can be more complex and is often implemented manually using a combination of copy constructors or cloning with recursion.

Let's look at an example of shallow copy and deep copy:

```java
class Address {
    String city;

    public Address(String city) {
        this.city = city;
    }
}

class Person {
    String name;
    Address address;

    public Person(String name, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    // Shallow copy constructor
    public Person(Person other) {
        this.name = other.name;
        this.address = other.address;
    }

    // Deep copy constructor
    public Person deepCopy() {
        Address newAddress = new Address(this.address.city);
        return new Person(this.name, newAddress);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Address originalAddress = new Address("New York");
        Person originalPerson = new Person("Alice", originalAddress);

        // Shallow copy
        Person shallowCopy = new Person(originalPerson);

        // Deep copy
        Person deepCopy = originalPerson.deepCopy();

        // Modify the city in the original address
        originalAddress.city = "Los Angeles";

        // Print the addresses of the copies
        System.out.println("Shallow Copy Address: " + shallowCopy.address.city); // Los Angeles
        System.out.println("Deep Copy Address: " + deepCopy.address.city);       // New York
    }
}
```

In this example, `Person` and `Address` classes demonstrate shallow and deep copying. The shallow copy constructor copies the references to the `Address` object, so changes to the original address affect the shallow copy. The deep copy constructor creates a new `Address` object with its own instance of `city`, making it independent of the original object.

Copying objects involves considerations such as object mutability, nested objects, and desired behavior, so choose the appropriate copying technique based on your requirements.

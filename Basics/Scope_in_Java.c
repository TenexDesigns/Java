In Java, the term "scope" refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables, methods, and classes within different parts of your code. Scopes determine where a variable or other entity can be used and accessed. There are several types of scopes in Java:

1. **Class Scope (Static Scope):**
   Variables, methods, and inner classes declared as `static` belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class. They can be accessed directly using the class name and are shared among all instances of the class.

2. **Instance Scope (Object Scope):**
   Variables, methods, and inner classes that are not declared as `static` are associated with instances (objects) of the class. They have a separate copy for each instance.

3. **Method Scope:**
   Variables declared within a method are only accessible within that method. They are created when the method is called and destroyed when the method exits.

4. **Block Scope:**
   Variables declared within a block (enclosed within curly braces `{}`) are only accessible within that block. This includes loops, conditional statements, and other code blocks.

5. **Loop Scope:**
   Variables declared within the initialization part of a loop (e.g., `for`, `while`, `do-while`) are only accessible within the loop body.

6. **Local Scope:**
   Variables declared within a method, block, or loop are considered local variables and are only accessible within their respective scope.




Here's an example to illustrate different scopes:

```java
public class ScopesExample {
    static int classScopeVariable = 10; // Class scope variable

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int methodScopeVariable = 20; // Method scope variable

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // Loop scope variable
            int loopScopeVariable = 30;
            System.out.println(loopScopeVariable); // Accessible within the loop
        }

        if (true) { // Block scope variable
            int blockScopeVariable = 40;
            System.out.println(blockScopeVariable); // Accessible within the block
        }

        System.out.println(classScopeVariable); // Accessible within the class
        System.out.println(methodScopeVariable); // Accessible within the method

        // Uncommenting the following line would result in a compile error
        // System.out.println(loopScopeVariable); // Not accessible outside the loop
    }
}
```

In this example, different variables are declared with various scopes: class scope, method scope, loop scope, and block scope.
The accessibility and lifespan of each variable depend on its scope. It's important to understand the scope of variables to write clean and error-free code.

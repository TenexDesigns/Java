In Java, there are methods in a superclass that are designed to be overridden by its subclasses. These methods are typically declared with the `abstract` keyword in the superclass. An abstract method is a method that has no implementation in the superclass and is meant to be implemented in its subclasses.

Here's what you need to know about abstract methods and how to work with them:

1. **Abstract Methods**:
   - An abstract method is a method declared in a superclass without a body (no curly braces and no implementation).
   - It's meant to be overridden by concrete (non-abstract) subclasses.
   - Abstract methods provide a common interface that subclasses must implement.

2. **Abstract Classes**:
   - A class that contains one or more abstract methods must be declared as abstract using the `abstract` keyword.
   - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. They serve as templates for concrete subclasses to extend.

3. **Subclass Responsibilities**:
   - When a subclass extends an abstract class that contains abstract methods, the subclass is required to provide concrete implementations for all the abstract methods.

Here's an example:

```java
abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area(); // Abstract method

    void printDescription() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    double radius;

    Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    double width, height;

    Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape circle = new Circle(5);
        Shape rectangle = new Rectangle(4, 6);

        circle.printDescription();
        System.out.println("Circle area: " + circle.area());

        rectangle.printDescription();
        System.out.println("Rectangle area: " + rectangle.area());
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` class is abstract and contains an abstract method `area()`. The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes extend `Shape` and provide concrete implementations for the `area()` method. The `Shape` class also has a non-abstract method `printDescription()`, which is inherited by the subclasses.

Abstract methods are particularly useful for creating a common interface that multiple classes share while allowing each class to define its own implementation. They enforce a consistent structure across different subclasses and promote polymorphism.

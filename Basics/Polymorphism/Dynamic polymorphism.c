Dynamic polymorphism, also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding, is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming. It occurs when a method is called on an object, and the specific implementation of the method that gets executed is determined by the actual type of the object at runtime. This allows for flexibility in code execution and enables the use of method overriding in subclasses.

Key points about dynamic polymorphism:

1. **Method Overriding:** Dynamic polymorphism relies on method overriding. When a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass, the subclass's version of the method will be executed when called on an object of the subclass.

2. **Object's Actual Type:** The implementation of the method that is executed is determined based on the actual type of the object, not the reference type that is used to refer to the object.

3. **Late Binding:** The decision about which overridden method to call is made at runtime, as opposed to compile time. This is why it's called "late binding."

Here's a simple example demonstrating dynamic polymorphism:

```java
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal1 = new Dog(); // Using superclass reference to a subclass object
        Animal animal2 = new Cat(); // Using superclass reference to another subclass object

        animal1.makeSound(); // Output: "Dog barks"
        animal2.makeSound(); // Output: "Cat meows"
    }
}
```

In this example, the `makeSound()` method is overridden in both the `Dog` and `Cat` subclasses. When the method is called on objects of these subclasses using references of the `Animal` superclass, the appropriate overridden version of the method is executed based on the actual object type.

Dynamic polymorphism allows for more flexible and extensible code by enabling you to define common behavior in a superclass and customize that behavior in subclasses. It plays a crucial role in achieving abstraction and designing complex software systems.

That is correct! Anonymous objects in Java are objects that are created without assigning them to a reference variable. They are useful for creating objects on the fly and passing them as arguments to methods. Here's a summary of anonymous objects in Java:

- Anonymous objects are created directly at the point of use without assigning them to a variable.
- They are commonly used when you need to perform a single operation or make a one-time call to a method.
- Anonymous objects are particularly useful when you don't need to reference the object again in your code.
- They have "expression scope," which means they exist only within the expression where they are created and evaluated.
- Anonymous objects can be created for both classes and interfaces.

Anonymous objects are commonly used when invoking methods that require objects as arguments. Here's an example:

```java
public class Messenger {
    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        System.out.println("Sending message: " + message);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an anonymous object of Messenger and invoking sendMessage()
        new Messenger().sendMessage("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

In this example, an anonymous object of the `Messenger` class is created, and the `sendMessage()` method is invoked on it directly. Since the anonymous object is created only for this method invocation, there's no need to assign it to a variable.

Anonymous objects can also be created for interfaces:

```java
interface Printer {
    void print(String text);
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an anonymous object of Printer and implementing the print() method
        Printer printer = new Printer() {
            @Override
            public void print(String text) {
                System.out.println("Printing: " + text);
            }
        };

        printer.print("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

In this example, an anonymous object is created for the `Printer` interface. The `print()` method is implemented within the anonymous object.

Anonymous objects provide a convenient way to create objects on the fly without the need for explicit variable declarations. They allow for more concise and expressive code.

Remember that anonymous objects have expression scope, meaning they are only valid within the expression where they are created. They are automatically eligible for garbage collection once the expression is evaluated.

I hope this clarifies the concept of anonymous objects in Java! Let me know if you have any further questions.

In Java, an anonymous object is an object that is instantiated without assigning it to a reference variable. Instead, it's created and used directly within a method call or expression. Anonymous objects are particularly useful when you need to perform a short-lived operation and don't need to store the object for future reference. They are often used in scenarios where a single operation is performed on an object and then the object is discarded.

Here's how you can use anonymous objects in Java:

```java
public class AnonymousObjectExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using an anonymous object to call a method
        int result = new Calculator().add(5, 3);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);

        // Using an anonymous object as a method argument
        printMessage(new Message("Hello, World!"));
    }

    static class Calculator {
        int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }

    static class Message {
        String content;

        Message(String content) {
            this.content = content;
        }
    }

    static void printMessage(Message message) {
        System.out.println(message.content);
    }
}
```

In the example above, an anonymous object of the `Calculator` class is created to call the `add` method. Similarly, an anonymous object of the `Message` class is passed as an argument to the `printMessage` method.

Anonymous objects are concise and can make your code cleaner by avoiding the need to create a named reference for a short-lived object. However, they should be used judiciously, as using named variables can make your code more readable and maintainable in the long run.

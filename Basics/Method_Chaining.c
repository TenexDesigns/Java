Method chaining, also known as fluent interface, is a programming technique that allows you to call multiple methods on an object one after another in a single line of code. Each method call returns an object (usually the same object on which the method was called), which enables the next method to be called on the returned object. This can lead to more readable and concise code, as it eliminates the need to create temporary variables to store intermediate results.

Here's an example of method chaining in Java:

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    public Person setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        return this;
    }
    
    public Person setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
        return this;
    }
    
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person()
            .setName("Alice")
            .setAge(30);
        
        person.displayInfo();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` class defines two methods (`setName` and `setAge`) that return the object itself (`this`). This allows you to chain method calls on the same object. By using method chaining, you can set the `name` and `age` properties of the `Person` object and then call the `displayInfo` method to print the information, all in a single line of code.

Method chaining is commonly used in libraries and APIs to provide a more concise and intuitive way to configure and use objects. However, it's important to design your classes and methods carefully when implementing method chaining to ensure that it enhances code readability and maintainability rather than making the code confusing.

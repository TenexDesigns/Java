In Java, the `toString()` method is a built-in method defined in the `Object` class. All classes in Java inherit from the `Object` class, so every class has access to the `toString()` method. The primary purpose of the `toString()` method is to provide a human-readable string representation of an object's state.

By default, the `toString()` method returns a string containing the class name, followed by the object's hash code. However, this default implementation may not be very informative, especially for user-defined classes. To make the output more meaningful, you can override the `toString()` method in your own classes.

Here's an example of how to use and override the `toString()` method:

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    // Override the toString() method
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Person[name=" + name + ", age=" + age + "]";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice", 30);
        System.out.println(person); // Calls the overridden toString() method
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` class overrides the `toString()` method to provide a custom string representation of a `Person` object. When you call `System.out.println(person)`, it implicitly calls the overridden `toString()` method to display a more meaningful output.

Overriding the `toString()` method is particularly useful when you want to provide a clear and concise way to display an object's state, especially for debugging or logging purposes. It's a good practice to override `toString()` for user-defined classes to enhance code readability.

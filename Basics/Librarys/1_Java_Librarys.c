In Java, there are several libraries available that provide additional functionality and features to enhance your projects. Here are some commonly used libraries and their functionalities:

**Java Standard Library:**
- The Java Standard Library is a collection of libraries provided by Java itself.
- It includes libraries such as `java.lang`, `java.util`, `java.io`, `java.nio`, `java.math`, `java.net`, `javax.swing`, `java.awt`, etc.
- These libraries provide essential classes and utilities for tasks like string manipulation, data structures, file I/O, networking, GUI development, and more.
- The Java Standard Library is automatically available in every Java project without requiring any additional setup.

**Apache Commons:**
- Apache Commons is an open-source project that provides a set of reusable Java components.
- It includes libraries like `Commons Lang`, `Commons IO`, `Commons Math`, `Commons Collections`, and more.
- Apache Commons libraries offer functionality beyond what is available in the Java Standard Library.
- For example, `Commons Lang` provides utilities for handling strings, arrays, dates, and reflection, while `Commons IO` offers enhanced file and stream handling capabilities.
- These libraries save development time by providing ready-made solutions to common programming tasks.

**Functional Java:**
- Functional Java is a library that focuses on functional programming in Java.
- It provides features like higher-order functions, immutable data structures, pattern matching, and monads.
- Functional Java enables you to write more expressive and concise code using functional programming paradigms.

Other Java libraries and frameworks exist for specific purposes, such as:

- **Spring Framework**: A popular framework for building Java applications, providing features like dependency injection, MVC architecture, and integration with other technologies.
- **Hibernate**: An object-relational mapping (ORM) library that simplifies database access and management.
- **JUnit**: A testing framework for unit testing Java code.
- **Gson**: A library for converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa.
- **Apache HttpClient**: A library for making HTTP requests and interacting with web services.
- **Log4j**: A logging library for generating log messages in Java applications.
- **Jackson**: A library for JSON serialization and deserialization.

These are just a few examples of the many libraries available in the Java ecosystem. The choice of libraries depends on the specific requirements of your project. You can explore more libraries based on your project needs and leverage their functionalities to enhance your Java applications.

Please note that when using external libraries, you need to ensure that you add the necessary dependencies to your project's build configuration (e.g., Maven or Gradle) and follow the library's documentation for usage instructions.

An anonymous inner class in Java is a local inner class that doesn't have a name and is defined and instantiated in a single expression. It's typically used for creating one-time implementations of interfaces or extending classes on the fly. Anonymous inner classes are particularly useful when you need to provide a quick implementation for a small piece of functionality.

Here's the basic syntax for creating an anonymous inner class:

```java
interface MyInterface {
    void doSomething();
}

public class AnonymousInnerClassExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyInterface anonymousInner = new MyInterface() {
            @Override
            public void doSomething() {
                System.out.println("Anonymous inner class is doing something...");
            }
        };

        anonymousInner.doSomething();
    }
}
```

In the example above, an anonymous inner class is created that implements the `MyInterface` interface and provides an implementation for the `doSomething` method.

Anonymous inner classes are often used for event listeners, runnable threads, or other situations where you need to create a small piece of code that implements an interface or extends a class without defining a separate named class. Keep in mind that if you need to reuse the implementation or if it becomes more complex, it's better to create a named class or consider using lambda expressions (starting from Java 8) for more concise syntax.

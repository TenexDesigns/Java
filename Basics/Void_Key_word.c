The `void` keyword in Java is used as a return type for methods that do not return any value. If a method is declared with a `void` return type, it means the method performs some action but does not produce any result that needs to be returned. Instead of `void`, you would use other data types (such as `int`, `double`, `String`, etc.) as the return type if the method needs to return a value of that type.

Here's a comparison between a method with `void` return type and methods with other non-`void` return types:

1. **`void` Return Type:**
   - Used when the method does not return any value.
   - The method performs actions or operations without producing a specific result.

```java
public void printMessage() {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

2. **Other Return Types (e.g., `int`, `double`, `String`):**
   - Used when the method needs to return a value of the specified data type.
   - The method performs operations and produces a specific result to be used elsewhere.

```java
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

In the example above, the `printMessage` method uses a `void` return type because it doesn't need to provide a value; it just prints a message. On the other hand, the `add` method uses an `int` return type because it performs a calculation and provides an `int` value as a result.

You can use various data types (primitive or object types) as return types based on the requirements of the method. The key idea is that when a method has a return type other than `void`, it should return a value of that type using the `return` statement. When a method is declared with a `void` return type, the `return` statement is not used to return a value; the method simply executes its code and completes its intended actions.

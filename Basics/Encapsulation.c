Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It involves bundling the data (fields) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation provides a way to control access to the internal state of an object and ensures that data is accessed and modified in a controlled manner.

The primary goals of encapsulation are:

1. **Data Hiding**: Restricting direct access to the internal data of an object from outside the class. This helps prevent unauthorized or unintended modification of the data.

2. **Abstraction**: Presenting a simplified interface to the outside world while hiding the complex implementation details.

3. **Encapsulation and Behavior**: Encapsulated data can be manipulated only through methods defined in the class, allowing the class to maintain consistent behavior and ensure data integrity.

Here's how encapsulation is used in Java, along with the concepts of getters and setters:

```java
class Person {
    private String name; // private field

    // Getter method to access the private field
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter method to modify the private field
    public void setName(String newName) {
        name = newName;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.setName("Alice"); // Using the setter method

        String name = person.getName(); // Using the getter method
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Person` class encapsulates the `name` field by making it `private`. This prevents direct access to the `name` field from outside the class. To interact with the `name` field, getter and setter methods are defined.

- The `getName()` method is a getter that allows retrieving the value of the `name` field.
- The `setName()` method is a setter that allows modifying the value of the `name` field.

Using getters and setters, you can provide controlled access to the private fields of a class while maintaining encapsulation. This approach allows you to implement validation, perform actions when fields are accessed or modified, and ensure consistent behavior throughout your codebase.

Encapsulation is crucial for building robust, maintainable, and extensible code since it separates implementation details from the external interface of a class.

Java supports several data types, which can be broadly categorized into two main groups: primitive data types and reference data types.

Primitive Data Types:

byte: 8-bit signed integer. Range: -128 to 127.
short: 16-bit signed integer. Range: -32,768 to 32,767.
int: 32-bit signed integer. Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1.
long: 64-bit signed integer. Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1.
float: 32-bit floating-point number. Useful for decimals and fractions.
double: 64-bit floating-point number. Used for more precise decimals and fractions.
char: 16-bit Unicode character. Represents a single character, e.g., 'A', '5', '$'.
boolean: Represents true or false values.

  
Reference Data Types:

Objects: References to instances of classes or arrays.
String: A sequence of characters. Though a reference type, its commonly used and has special treatment in Java.
Its important to note that primitive data types are stored directly in memory, while reference data types store references (memory addresses) to the actual data stored elsewhere in memory.






  
You can use these data types to declare variables and store values of different types in Java. For example:

// Primitive Data Types
byte myByte = 10;
short myShort = 1000;
int myInt = 100000;
long myLong = 1000000000L; // Note the 'L' suffix for long values.
float myFloat = 3.14f; // Note the 'f' suffix for float values.
double myDouble = 3.14159265359;
char myChar = 'A';
boolean myBool = true;

// Reference Data Type
String myString = "Hello, World!";

  
As of Java 5, Java also introduced autoboxing and unboxing, which allow automatic conversion between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes (e.g., int to Integer). This provides more flexibility when working with primitive types in the context of collections and other Java APIs that expect objects.

Additionally, Java allows you to define your own custom data types using classes and interfaces, enabling you to create complex and custom data structures to suit your applications needs.

Java has two types of data types: Primitive and Non-primitive (also known as Reference data types) javatpoint.com, geeksforgeeks.org, digitalocean.com.

Primitive Data Types: These represent the simplest and most basic data types in Java. They include:

byte: 8-bit integer data type with a range from -128 to 127.
short: 16-bit integer data type with a range from -32,768 to 32,767.
int: 32-bit integer data type with a range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
long: 64-bit integer data type with a range from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
float: 32-bit floating-point data type with decimal precision.
double: 64-bit floating-point data type with higher decimal precision than float.
char: 16-bit Unicode character data type representing single characters like 'A', 'b', '$', etc.
boolean: It has only two possible values: true and false linkedin.com, baeldung.com.
Non-primitive Data Types: These include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays. The most common non-primitive data type is String, which is a sequence of characters geeksforgeeks.org, educba.com.

Here is an example of using different data types in Java:

// Primitive Data Types
byte a = 10;
short b = 20;
int c = 30;
long d = 40L;
float e = 50.0f;
double f = 60.0d;
char g = 'G';
boolean h = true;

// Non-primitive Data Types
String str = "Hello, World!";
In Java, when you declare a variable, you must specify its type. Each data type requires a different amount of memory and has some specific operations which can be performed over it digitalocean.com.

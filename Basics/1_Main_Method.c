In Java, the terms "main method" and "Main class" refer to different concepts related to the execution of a Java program.

1. **Main Method:**
   The main method is the entry point of a Java program. It is the method that is called when you run a Java application. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for the `public static void main(String[] args)` method within a class and starts the program's execution from there. This method must be defined in your code to start running the program.

   ```java
   public class MyProgram {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Program code
       }
   }
   ```

   In the above example, `main` is the main method of the `MyProgram` class. It serves as the starting point of execution for the entire program.

2. **Main Class:**
   The main class is the class that contains the main method. It is the class where the `main` method is defined. In most Java applications, you define the main method in a specific class, which serves as the entry point of your program.

   ```java
   public class MyProgram {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Program code
       }
   }
   ```

   In this example, `MyProgram` is the main class, as it contains the main method. The main class is responsible for initializing the program and often serves as a central point for coordinating different parts of the application.

It's important to note that you can have multiple classes in a Java program, but only one class with the main method can be used as the entry point. Other classes can be used to define various components, objects, and functionalities of your application.

In summary, the main method is the entry point for the programs execution, and the main class is the class that contains the main method. The main class is where the execution begins, and from there, the program can call methods and create objects to perform specific tasks.

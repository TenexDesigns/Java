Certainly! Heres an example of how to accept user input in Java using the `Scanner` class, which is commonly used for reading input from the console:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserInputExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the console
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user for input
        System.out.print("Enter your name: ");

        // Read a line of text entered by the user
        String name = scanner.nextLine();

        // Prompt the user for another input
        System.out.print("Enter your age: ");

        // Read an integer entered by the user
        int age = scanner.nextInt();

        // Close the scanner
        scanner.close();

        // Display the user's input
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old.");
    }
}
```

In this example:

1. We import the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package.
2. We create a `Scanner` object named `scanner` to read input from `System.in`, which represents the standard input stream (typically the keyboard).
3. We prompt the user to enter their name using `System.out.print("Enter your name: ")`, and then use `scanner.nextLine()` to read the entire line of text entered by the user.
4. Similarly, we prompt the user to enter their age, and then use `scanner.nextInt()` to read an integer value.
5. Finally, we close the `scanner` using `scanner.close()` to release any resources associated with it.

Remember to handle user input carefully. The `Scanner` class provides various methods for reading different types of data (`nextLine()`, `nextInt()`, `nextDouble()`, etc.), and you should use the appropriate method based on the type of input you expect from the user. Additionally, consider handling exceptions that may occur if the input doesn't match the expected format.

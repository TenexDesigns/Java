The enhanced for loop, also known as the "for-each" loop, is a feature introduced in Java to simplify the process of iterating over arrays and collections.
  It provides a cleaner and more concise syntax for iterating through elements without needing to manage indices explicitly. 
  The for-each loop is primarily used when you want to iterate through all the elements of an array, collection, or other iterable data structures.

The syntax of the enhanced for loop is as follows:

```java
for (ElementType element : collection) {
    // Code to be executed for each element
}
```

Where:
- `ElementType` is the data type of elements in the collection.
- `collection` is the array or collection you want to iterate over.
- `element` is a variable that takes on the value of each element in the collection during each iteration.

Heres an example of using the enhanced for loop with an array and an ArrayList:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ForEachLoopExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbersArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        System.out.println("Iterating through array:");
        for (int num : numbersArray) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();

        ArrayList<String> namesList = new ArrayList<>();
        namesList.add("Alice");
        namesList.add("Bob");
        namesList.add("Charlie");

        System.out.println("Iterating through ArrayList:");
        for (String name : namesList) {
            System.out.println(name);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the enhanced for loop iterates over both the array `numbersArray` and the `namesList` ArrayList. The loop variable (`num` and `name`) takes on each element's value in the array or collection during each iteration, making it easy to work with the individual elements.

Keep in mind that the enhanced for loop is suitable for scenarios where you need to iterate through all elements sequentially. If you require access to the index, you would need to use a traditional `for` loop. Additionally, the enhanced for loop is read-only, so you can't use it to modify the elements of an array or collection during iteration.

The for-each loop in Java, also known as the enhanced for loop, was introduced in Java 5. It is used to traverse through elements of arrays and collections. Its an alternate technique specifically introduced to traverse arrays or collections, making it easier to go through a group of elements by doing the counting automatically [Source 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/for-each-loop-in-java/), [Source 3](https://www.baeldung.com/java-for-each-loop), [Source 5](https://www.javatpoint.com/for-each-loop), [Source 6](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/enhanced-for-loop), [Source 7](https://medium.com/@swapnil.manorkar/explain-for-each-loop-in-java-e03a8c96a4f6), [Source 9](https://www.educba.com/for-each-loop-in-java/).

Here is the syntax for the for-each loop:

```java
for (type var : array) 
{ 
    statements using var;
}
```

In this syntax, `type` is the base type of the array, `var` is a variable that is the same type as the base type of the array, and `array` is the array name. In the loop body, you can use the loop variable `var` rather than using an indexed array element [Source 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/for-each-loop-in-java/), [Source 5](https://www.javatpoint.com/for-each-loop), [Source 9](https://www.educba.com/for-each-loop-in-java/).

The for-each loop works by traversing the array or collection until the last element. For each element, it stores the element in the variable and executes the body of the for-each loop [Source 5](https://www.javatpoint.com/for-each-loop).

Here is an example of using the for-each loop to iterate over an array of integers:

```java
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int number : numbers) {
    System.out.println(number);
}
```

In this example, the for-each loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` array and prints it out.

Its important to note that the for-each loop is read-only, meaning you cannot modify the original array/collection by modifying the iteration variable. Also, the type specified in the for-each loop must match the type of the elements in the collection [Source 9](https://www.educba.com/for-each-loop-in-java/).

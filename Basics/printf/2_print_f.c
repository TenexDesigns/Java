Sure! I'm glad you understood the concept of the `printf()` method and its format specifiers. Now, let's work on a task to practice using `printf()` with different format specifiers.

**Task**: Write a Java program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle and prints the values using `printf()`. The program should prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle and then output the calculated area and perimeter with proper formatting.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you solve the task:

1. Import the necessary classes for user input and formatting:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

2. Create a `Scanner` object to read user input:
```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```

3. Prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle:
```java
System.out.print("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
double length = scanner.nextDouble();

System.out.print("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
double width = scanner.nextDouble();
```

4. Calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle:
```java
double area = length * width;
double perimeter = 2 * (length + width);
```

5. Use `printf()` to print the calculated values with proper formatting:
```java
System.out.printf("Area: %.2f%n", area);
System.out.printf("Perimeter: %.2f%n", perimeter);
```

6. Close the `Scanner` object to release resources:
```java
scanner.close();
```

Putting it all together, heres the complete code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Rectangle {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
        double length = scanner.nextDouble();

        System.out.print("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
        double width = scanner.nextDouble();

        double area = length * width;
        double perimeter = 2 * (length + width);

        System.out.printf("Area: %.2f%n", area);
        System.out.printf("Perimeter: %.2f%n", perimeter);

        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

When you run this program, it will ask the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle. Then it will calculate and print the area and perimeter of the rectangle with 2 decimal places using `printf()`.

Feel free to modify the code or ask any questions if you need further assistance!

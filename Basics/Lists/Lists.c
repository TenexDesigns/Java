In Java, the List interface is part of the Java Collections Framework and extends the Collection interface. It is an ordered collection of elements which can contain duplicate values. Lists can also contain null values. The List interface provides methods to manipulate the elements in the list based on their index positions [Source 0](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html), [Source 2](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-list).

There are several types of List implementations in Java. The most commonly used are:

1. **ArrayList**: This is a resizable array implementation of the List interface. It is often used because of its efficiency in random access operations.

2. **LinkedList**: This is a doubly-linked list implementation of the List interface. It is often used for efficient insertion and removal operations.

3. **Vector**: This is a synchronized resizable array implementation of the List interface. It is similar to ArrayList, but with synchronization.

4. **Stack**: This is a subclass of Vector that implements a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of elements [Source 1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/implementations/list.html), [Source 3](https://www.baeldung.com/java-list-interface), [Source 4](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-lists-work-in-java/).

Here is an example of how you can create and use a List in Java:

```java
// Create a List using ArrayList
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
// Add elements to the list
list.add("Apple");
list.add("Banana");
list.add("Cherry");
// Access elements from the list
String firstFruit = list.get(0); // returns "Apple"
// Remove elements from the list
list.remove(0); // removes "Apple" from the list
```

The List interface provides a variety of methods for manipulating the elements in the list. Some of the commonly used methods include:

- `add(E e)`: Appends the specified element to the end of the list.
- `add(int index, E element)`: Inserts the specified element at the specified position in the list.
- `remove(int index)`: Removes the element at the specified position in the list.
- `get(int index)`: Returns the element at the specified position in the list.
- `set(int index, E element)`: Replaces the element at the specified position in the list with the specified element.
- `size()`: Returns the number of elements in the list.
- `contains(Object o)`: Returns true if the list contains the specified element.
- `indexOf(Object o)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in the list, or -1 if the list does not contain the element.
- `listIterator()`: Returns a list iterator over the elements in the list [Source 0](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html), [Source 3](https://www.baeldung.com/java-list-interface).
  
These are just a few of the methods provided by the List interface. The full list of methods and their detailed descriptions can be found in the [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html).

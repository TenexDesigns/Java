In Java, you can create arrays of objects just like you create arrays of primitive data types. An array of objects allows you to store multiple instances of a class in a single array structure. Each element of the array is an object of the specified class.

Here's how you can create and use arrays of objects in Java:

```java
class Student {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Student[name=" + name + ", age=" + age + "]";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an array of Student objects
        Student[] students = new Student[3];

        // Initializing the array with Student objects
        students[0] = new Student("Alice", 20);
        students[1] = new Student("Bob", 21);
        students[2] = new Student("Carol", 22);

        // Accessing and printing elements of the array
        for (int i = 0; i < students.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(students[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, an array of `Student` objects is created, and each element is initialized with a new instance of the `Student` class. The `toString()` method in the `Student` class is overridden to provide a customized string representation.

Remember that when you create an array of objects, the array itself is just a container for references to the actual objects. Each element in the array holds a reference to a separate object in memory.

Arrays of objects are useful when you need to manage multiple instances of a class in a structured way, such as when working with collections of data like lists of students, employees, products, and so on.

A Java executable JAR file (Java Archive) is a compressed file format that contains compiled Java classes and resources, along with metadata and optional configuration files. It's a self-contained executable format that allows you to package your Java application along with its dependencies and run it easily on any system with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

Here's how you can create and run a Java executable JAR file:

1. **Creating an Executable JAR:**
   To create an executable JAR, you need to include a manifest file that specifies the main class of your application. The main class is the entry point to your program.

   ```
   /myapp
     |-- /src
         |-- Main.java (main class)
     |-- /lib
         |-- dependency1.jar
         |-- dependency2.jar
     |-- /META-INF
         |-- MANIFEST.MF
   ```

   The `MANIFEST.MF` file should contain a line like this:

   ```
   Main-Class: com.example.Main
   ```

   You can create the JAR using the `jar` command-line tool:

   ```
   jar cfm myapp.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -C . .
   ```

2. **Running the Executable JAR:**
   To run the executable JAR, you simply use the `java` command followed by the JAR file name:

   ```
   java -jar myapp.jar
   ```

   The Java runtime will read the manifest file, locate the specified main class, and execute the `main` method.

3. **Handling Dependencies:**
   If your application has external dependencies, you can either include the dependency JARs inside your executable JAR or specify them in the classpath using the `-cp` or `-classpath` option when running the JAR.

   ```
   java -jar myapp.jar -cp dependency1.jar:dependency2.jar
   ```

Executable JARs are a convenient way to distribute and share Java applications, as they encapsulate both the application code and its dependencies. However, keep in mind that JAR files are essentially archives, so they can't include native libraries or resources outside of the JAR structure. For more complex applications, you might consider using build tools like Maven or Gradle to manage dependencies and create executable JARs automatically.
